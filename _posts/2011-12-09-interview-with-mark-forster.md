I've tried it with four different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer) and it works fine for me with all of them.

I am a serial entrepreneur (I am 67, so “serial” means a long time) but never reduced “success” to so elegant a definition. I read this site daily; the finding tidbits helpful in moving my ball forward. Thanks Mark and friends.

Hi Mark,  
thank you for the books and all your efforts. I have just recently started using superfocus after reading Do it tomorrow book I was curious to understand it more so I came across your website and found all this new systems... very helpful indeed. I am struggling to organize my self and getting things done especially that I am working on my PhD (writing my thesis) and I always feel I do not have time to do other tasks. I do not know how I can use this system efficiently in my case.? and do we need a calender, a planner and a notebook of tasks..what is the most effective and less confusing way to GTD.   
thank you

Any of the systems should work in your situation, but I would recommend SuperFocus as currently the best for most purposes. There is a link in the top menu to the rules. You will need a calendar, a notebook of tasks and some way of bringing forward tasks which need to be done on or after a specific date.  
  
In addition:  
  
1) You may find it more efficient to work on your PhD in specific time blocks, rather than put it into the system. If you do decide to do this, then try to keep to the times you have allocated exactly. This will ensure that you give adequate time to your PhD without its taking over the whole of your life.  
  
2) Keep tasks which are not part of your PhD down to what is essential. Don't let them grow.
