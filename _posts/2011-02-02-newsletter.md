Just a quick notice to say that my the first issue of my Newsletter for a long time will be sent out at 7.30 a.m. GMT tomorrow. Don’t miss it!

I’m planning to make the Newsletter much more regular now and I intend it to contain articles of interest, as well as notices of seminars, activity on the blog and so on.

If you are not already receiving it, you can subscribe in the box at the top of the right hand margin.

This is good to hear. (You spelled Newsletter rong.)  
  
[Thanks, Alan. Corrected]

Signing up now. Mark certainly has been more active on his site recently. I'm wondering if this is the result of generally increased productivity with SF3, or just renewed focus on the website.  
  
It is possible that he \*meant\* to write "Newletter" to emphasize that there will be a new newsletter.

Well, Alan, it IS a NEW letter...  
  
But anyways, woohoo Mark! Congratulations! Your SFv.3 is really working.

i read Mark's work some years ago and kind of lost track - and now am sparked on by this new email and feeling i need re-introduction to the methods.   
  
BUT my big question -- as mother of a 15-year daughter now going through GCSE exams and prep for finals in May/June -- what can i do to help her? has your method been "tested" on teenagers? my daugther is not the most organised, despite my attempts at support -- and her latest report tells the same story, "with more focus and regular completion of her prep" she will perform better. she is a mostly B student, with A's, but falls down mostly with organising her prep. can this system help? and how to use with a teenager?

My new system hasn't been tested on anyone yet, except me. I think it would work fine for a teenager - in fact I wish I'd had this system when I was at school.   
  
Getting a teenager to do it though is another matter!

It's generally increased productivity with SF3 resulting in renewed focus on the website.
