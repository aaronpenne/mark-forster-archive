My long-awaited Final Version time management system is ready for release, and the good news is that it will be free of charge. I am starting a new newsletter for the purpose of distributing the initial instructions for the new system - and later on the newsletter will include in-depth articles about it.

To sign up for the Final Version newsletter, fill in the Subscribe Email Newsletter form in the right margin. If you are already a subscriber to my existing newsletter, you will be asked whether you want to update your profile. The answer is yes, you do!

Please note that the instructions will not be distributed in my existing newsletter, nor will they appear on this website, so if you don’t sign up you won’t receive them.

The instructions will be issued to all subscribers to the Final Version newsletter within the next few days.

Every issue of the newsletter will contain an Unsubscribe link, so you can unsubscribe even more easily than you subscribe.

(And btw the new system is called the Final Version not because it’s the final word on time management for all time, but because it’s definitely the final time management system that I will be producing!)

Thank you Mark. I'm so looking forward to this. I've been using super focus for months now, and it is truly remarkable. I am a full time pastor of a large congregation, a trustee of a school board with 3000 employees and 24000 students and I'm working on my doctorate in religious studies, and somehow, with the help of your time management systems, I've been able to balance all this quite easily without going insane. (yet)   
  
Can't wait!!!

Hi Mark,   
I loved your books so I am looking forward to your new system.  
Do you think it is compatible with the TaskDash SW for Android?  
  
[As long as you can make a list on it and can mark up tasks in some way it will be fine - MF]

That's good news Mark.  
  
I have been straying from the Forum like a lost sheep for several months and for several uninteresting reasons. When I have been visiting recently, I have been a tad confused about all the versions in use, so a FINAL version is appropriate.  
  
Although a member on this forum since December 2008 (AF/AF1), I hope the instructions will cater for beginners as well.  
  
However, I have been using a modicum of AF/SF/whatever with my current incarnation which is a combination of a Moleskine pocket notebook ("Write it down" as many on this Forum exhort) and electronic (Ultimate To-Do List, Android, syncs with Toodeldo).  
  
I await with bated breath, again.

As ever, unpredictable to the last.  
  
Thank you Mark.   
  
I hope your website's 'Donate' button is clicked as many times as your generosity deserves.

Thank you Mark. I'm so desperate for this.  
  
I already clicked the 'Donate' button.

Thanks, Mark. To use a German idiom: "Ich bin gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen" (hard to translate, since it's a pun: "gespannt" can mean "curious", "excited", "eagerly expecting", but also "bow-tout" - Flitzebogen or Bogen is "bow").

"Ich bin gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen" – ich auch! Und wie!

Hey Mark, now with this 'final version' you absolutely have to have an official iPhone app so most of the world will use it.   
Seriously Mr. Forster, give us an iOS app!

Thanks Mark - really looking forward to reading the FV instructions. Does this mean you can now have a REAL holiday instead of writing a book? Hope so!

How do I sign up!?!  
  
I type in my email address then it asks if I want to be sent an email to update my profile. I say yes. I then get an email that only has two options:  
  
( ) Unsubscribe me from ALL mailings.  
( ) I wish to continue receiving occasional mailings based on my interests.  
  
Preferred email format   
( ) HTML ( ) Text  
   
Nothing about final version?  
  
[Go for the second option. - MF]

Also, a great relief to me personally. I've signed up, so now I haven't a long wait looming ahead anymore!   
  
Thanks!

"...within the next few days." Will you be sending it on the earlier or later end of that scale? :)   
  
I'm excited!  
  
[The earlier end of the scale - it's now been sent - MF]

Great news. And an app (for Android!) would be nice. Or some recommendations which apps fit the bill.
