I have added a Korean translation to the SuperFocus instructions. Many thanks to Seokhwan Kim for translating them.

I am always glad to see that such initiatives as translating some applications in order to help others use some applications or programmes are created more and more often. Such a difficult thing as a <a  
href ="<http://www.rosettatranslation.com/korean-translation/">Korean> translation</a> is not always easy to access (well... if you do nto count such programmes as Google translator!)  
  
When you are having some important documents translated, always make sure you use a trusted and reliable translation company, so that the quality will be always impeccable, and price - affordable.
