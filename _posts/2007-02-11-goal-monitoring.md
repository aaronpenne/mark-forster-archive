Although my idea of daily monitoring my Adsense income didn’t work out very well, yet my average daily income this month is currently $7.12 - vastly higher than my original aim.So how come it’s risen so fast in spite of the fact that I abandoned the method I was experimenting with?Basically I have just been using the four-step method of goal achievement which I have often written about in the past:1. [Define the goal enough to recognise it when you get there.](/blog/2006/8/21/getting-to-your-goals-step-one.html)
2. [Know where you are now](/blog/2006/8/28/getting-to-your-goals-step-two.html)
3. [Move in the direction you want to go in](/blog/2006/9/11/getting-to-your-goals-step-three.html)
4. [Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until you reach the goal](/blog/2006/9/18/getting-to-your-goals-step-four.html)These four steps sound as if they are far too simple. But they are not. Keeping to them is the basis of all successful goal achievement. If you think of times when you have failed to get to a goal, it will usually be because you have failed to keep to this four step sequence.

Congrats on the income level. The manner in which you have redesinged your blog doens't work for me. Too many advertisments and click throughs to follow along pleasantly. I loved it before though, thought it was clean and neat. Good luck.

I am requesting advice on setting goals. I have used AF in the united states for about a month and love it. I have always read about goal setting and know how to set goals in theory but the actual nuts and bolts of tracking them elude me. Task lists always eluded me as well until AutoFocus. Can you recommend a method of tracking goals? Thank you so much. A.L. Jackson
