Following the example of some book publishers, I’ve decided to start writing in my large Moleskine unlined notebook sideways on. The result is that I get a writing surface which is as wide as an A4 sheet and slightly shorter. As a writing surface it’s beautiful - which is more than can be said for my handwriting!

(I always have trouble with the size descriptions of Moleskine notebooks. They come in three sizes, Pocket, Large and Extra Large - which any normal person would call Small, Standard and Large respectively.)

Moleskine also does A4 plain notebooks so you can in effect get an A3 page to scribble on by using the 2 pages side on. Apologies to US readers on site not sure where A4 and A3 sit re folio, legal etc

A4 is a bit longer than letter and a bit shorter than legal.  
  
A3 is the equivalent of ledger/tabloid.
