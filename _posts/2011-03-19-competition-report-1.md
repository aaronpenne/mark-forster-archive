The current competition question is:“In SuperFocus, how would you handle the project of writing an historical novel and getting it published?”Assume you are already established as an historical novelist.This competition is off to a bit of a slow start with only three attempts to answer the question so far, and only one of those has made any serious attempt to analyse what would be involved.Just to clear up any confusion, the question is about how to handle a large, multifaceted, personal project in SuperFocus. The historical novel is just an example - a case study.There’s plenty of scope for further answers. After all the pages and pages of discussion about project handling on the Discussion Forum, I’m sure there are many better answers to come.Answers on the original post please. You can’t post them here.
