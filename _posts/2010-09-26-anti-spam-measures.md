Because spam has become a major problem on this site, I have been forced to make the following changes:

1) Comments on blog articles will now require approval from me before appearing.

2) You will need to be registered before you can post to the Discussion Group. Click here for instructions on how to register.

It's unfortunate but it had to be done. I'd say it's a good move. Please everyone sign up as this forum can still use your participation.   
  
And it's nice to see Mark's last post is no longer about procrastination ;-)

Thanks, Mark.  
  
Btw, is there a way for a member to edit her/his old posts?

No, there isn't. But if there's anything you really need to change, you can make another posting asking me to make the edit. Or you can email me.
