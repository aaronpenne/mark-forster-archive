Is DIT still alive?

“The best way to think of what happens in DIT is that it’s a conveyor  belt. You have your station on the conveyor belt where you do the work  that comes down the line to you. If there is more work on the conveyor  belt than you are capable of doing, you can’t keep up with it and the  work will start to fall of the end of the belt…”
