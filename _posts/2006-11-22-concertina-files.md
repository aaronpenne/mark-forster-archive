A correspondent today has reminded me of the advantages of concertina files. I use one all the time - it’s numbered from 1-31 for the days of the month. It’s the ideal place to file all those pieces of paper which you are going to need on a specific date but don’t fit easily into your filing system. Things like tickets, invitations, seminar programs, directions and so on. No need to work out whether you filed your theatre tickets under “Entertainment”, “Arts” or “Personal Expenses”; just go to the date and there they are.You can buy concertina files which are tabbed with the months of the year. Personally I don’t bother with this. Whether a piece of paper relates to November 22nd, January 22nd or even November 22nd 2007, it all goes under 22. I don’t find that I have sufficient pieces of paper in each date to make it confusing.
