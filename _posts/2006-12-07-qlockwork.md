Yesterday I downloaded an interesting program called Qlockwork, which keeps a record of everything that you do on your computer. It's a useful way to see the reality of how you are spending your time.

The picture above shows the last hour of work for me yesterday. First I was doing some work on my blog, followed by a gap while I nipped to the shops for something, then a bit more on the blog, a short session with QA-Coach, and finally backing up my computer. My computer was switched off at exactly 6 o'clock in accordance with my new Structuring the Day rules.

I just ran the program and it did all this by itself. I haven't even glanced at the instructions yet. There's loads more one can do with it, so I will be exploring its capabilities over the next few days.
