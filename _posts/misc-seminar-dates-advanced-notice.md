For your diary:

I am introducing a whole day seminar for those who have read Do It Tomorrow and would like the opportunity to explore how to adapt it to their own particular circumstances and to share their experiences of the system with other people. It will be an excellent opportunity to tailor the general principles contained in the book to your own working environment.

The cost for the whole day will be £225 + VAT. Meals are not included.

The first two of these seminars will be run in Horsham, West Sussex on the following dates:

Booking for these seminars will open in the next few days. Watch out for it!
