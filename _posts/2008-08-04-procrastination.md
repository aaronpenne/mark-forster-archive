Does this seem familiar somehow?

Oh yes, very familiar. LOL! Love the cartoon. I call myself "the Queen of Sidetrackedville" (to myself) when I find I'm doing something altogether different in the middle of another task.

Oh my does this have a familiar ring, and yes, procrastination is so easy. Thank you for adding humor to this sidetracking phenomena which can be bigger than life itself. Tomorrow is another day, and we will see who is on first....focus or procrastination.
