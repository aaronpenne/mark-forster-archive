Whew! the website is now open to the public and the old one closed down with a redirection until www.markforster.squarespace.com is reassigned, which won't be until October 2nd.

I decided to move websites on Monday, at which stage I had absolutely no idea how or where I might move it to - this has been a great example of how fast a Current Initiative can move once it gets started.
