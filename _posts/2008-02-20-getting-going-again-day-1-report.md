I left my last posting on Getting Going Again at 8.40 a.m. with the question of how long would it take to finish my Will Do List today?

Well, the answer is that I finished it at 11.15 a.m. That included a good half-hour wasted because my computer was playing up.

Lots of things have sprung into my mind though to go into my Task Diary for tomorrow - including the all-important item “Think About Future of Business”. I’ve written before on how important it is to include project management items in one’s Task Diary. “Think About X” is one - it may be followed by “Investigate X”, “Discuss X with Y”, “Plan X” and so on.

Also I have added a couple of items to the Will Do list: “Read Blogs” (that is to say other people’s blogs) and “Reply to Comments” (on my own blog).

The most important thing to avoid here is to add too many things to either the Will Do list or to the Task List. I must keep my projects and activities well audited.

Buy Do It Tomorrow

I thought I had written an article on managing projects for this website, but I can’t find it. So I’ve put a task in my diary for tomorrow “Write article on managing projects”

And here it is!

Hi Mark  
This is really exciting reading! It's similar to reading about the fateful journey of the prodical son returning to his homeland! LOL!  
  
You're not only very intelligent and highly creative/innovative.......you're also quite generous in spirit to share yourself in such a way to both teach and inspire us! I am most grateful to you on so many levels.  
  
Please keep us posted. This is true testimony to the old adage....You learn best by teaching.  
  
Many thanks!

Hi Mark, I'm being mischievous but since I am rereading 'make your dreams come true' what happened to the methods contained in this book?  
Good luck with the backlog.  
Rgds Rob.

Dear Rob  
There's no mystery about that. In fact over the last year I have been trying to simplify the methods in "Dreams" down to the absolute bare minimum. Although the methods in Dreams look very simple, they in fact require quite a lot of work, and I think the truth is that, if they've got to have a system, most people prefer a more "mechanical" one.  
  
Unfortunately my efforts weren't successful.

As a postscript to my last comment (to Rob), I have put an entry in my Task Diary for tomorrow to write a posting about the tension between "structure" and "unstructure". So keep reading!
