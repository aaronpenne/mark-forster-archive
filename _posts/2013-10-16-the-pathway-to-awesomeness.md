The ebook is now available at Hyperink (the publishers) and both Amazon US and Amazon UK. Please note that you can only use the $1 discount coupon code (AWESOME) at Hyperink.Hyperink has the book in Kindle, iPad, Nook and PDF formats.If you buy the book from Hyperink, have a look at some of their other titles while you’re there. They’ve got an increasingly interesting selection.And wherever you buy the book from, please write a review!“I am a stay-at-home mother willing to be working and using my best skills for things other than the daily backlog of home activities.  You have collected here a group of your posts that made sense to me before but now even more because of the way you have arranged them in this ebook. I have been longing to state what I want to do, where I want to go, what work would I like, etc., and find it difficult. But the exercise of stating what I don’t want makes sense, and it is already allowing the flow of more clear ideas in my mind.  It was an exercise my dad taught me long ago for some short essay at school and I totally recreated that moment and the relief of finding solutions. I’ll be working and practicing some of these ideas as you suggest.” Wendy Putzeys de Lee, Guatemala

How do you enter a coupon code when buying a Kindle book? I just see a "Buy now with 1-Click" button.

Very inspiring book, thank you Mark.I've just started it, and in a lot of ways it reminds me of some works like "Excuses begone" by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer or "The Road of Self-Dependence" by Jorge Bucay, in the sense that it gives insights on accountability (which is the "burden" of freedom) and the identification of very cozy and convenient self-limiting beliefs. Of course, the emphasis here is on the more practical side, which indeed is we're after in this case!

I bought it on Kindle and am reading a little bit each day. Having read the first two essays, I'm finding it exceedingly inspirational. I am motivated to change the things I have direct control over. Thank you, Mark!

Congrats on the new book. Will check it out. Like the title too, haha.
A new book and free report on how to build discipline, needed for getting things done and achieving goals, beyond theories, is available at
[http://www.learningthesteel.com/](http://www.learningthesteel.com/)Not a big fan of Dwyer. But will check out the book regardless.
