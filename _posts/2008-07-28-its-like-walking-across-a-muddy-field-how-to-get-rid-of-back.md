There are basically two types of task which we are faced with during
a typical day. First there is the type of task which either gets done
or doesn’t get done. You either renew the car insurance or you don’t.
You either paint the bedroom or you don’t. You either buy a new dress
or you don’t. You either send your great aunt a birthday card or you
don’t. The consequences of doing or not doing this type of task may
range from the trivial to the momentous, but essentially they are
one-offs.

Then there is the type of task which produces a backlog
if it is not attended to. Dealing with paper is the classic example of
this type of task. Have you ever noticed how paper has the strange
tendency to breed if given the chance? Leave two bits of paper together
overnight and miraculously when you come down in the morning you have a
six-inch pile of papers in various stages of inaction. Leave the pile
on its own for another 24 hours and you have an office full of piles of
paper.

The modern age has produced an even worse backlog producer
— the email. Leave your inbox for 24 hours and you will have hundreds
of these little monsters clamouring for your attention. I have had
clients who complain that they have literally thousands of emails they
haven’t even got round to reading.

Other well-known backlog
producers are phone calls, filing, and updating client records. There
may be others that are peculiar to your life.

The real problem
with backlogs is that they take you out of the present. Instead of
dealing with today’s work, you are constantly trying to catch up. It’s
the difference between walking along a well-defined path and walking
across a muddy field. On the path you can walk freely, but in the field
your boots get caked in mud and you have to put out more and more
effort while going slower and slower.

Backlogs can make people
feel hopeless. It may seem impossible to catch up. And even if you do
catch up you may only find yourself almost immediately slipping back
again.

So how can you deal with them once and for all?

STEP
ONE — DRAW A LINE. Say to yourself “Everything that comes in from now
on I will deal with immediately. And I will tackle the backlog bit by
bit.” Ring fence the backlogs so that they don’t get any bigger.

STEP
TWO — CLEAR INCOMING MATERIAL DAILY. The best way to deal with incoming
paper, emails, phone calls, etc. is to have a check list which you go
through several times a day. So I have a list which comprises about
five items and I go through it checking each one off. I do this three
times a day — first thing, after lunch and early evening. Because this
keeps me right on top of all incoming material, I can sometimes get
through the list in as little as ten minutes. More often it takes me an
hour or more — but I don’t have any backlogs. The rest of my time is
free to get on with creative work.

STEP THREE — REDUCE THE
INCOMING VOLUME. One of the reasons backlogs build up in the first
place is because we attract far too much inessential stuff. Chuck junk
mail in the trash without even opening it. Cancel subscriptions for
newsletters you don’t read (you DO read mine!). Don’t write off for
things you don’t need. Keep asking yourself “Why am I receiving this?”.

STEP
FOUR — GET RID OF THE BACKLOGS BIT BY BIT. If you do steps one and two
correctly, your backlogs can now only get smaller. Don’t try to get rid
of the lot in one go. Keep chipping away at them. With emails, try
clearing one day at a time, starting with the oldest. With paper, try
clearing it one subject at a time — such as all bank statements, then
all bills, then all client letters and so forth.

I am re-issuing some old articles as blog entries partly in order to get a new audience for them, and partly in order to get all my articles in one place. This is the first.

Hi Mark  
This was the article you recommended to me.two years ago. As a result, I cleared my backlog in December 2006. I haven't had one since. This article and your encouragement helped me immensely! I'll always be grateful to you for that!

Stimulating post, Mark. I can't get my head around it, though. Seems like the latter category (backlog-producing) is more systemic than tactical.

Yes, you're probably right about the systemic v. tactical. What do you see as the consequences of that?
