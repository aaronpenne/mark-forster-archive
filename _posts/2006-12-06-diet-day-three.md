There's nothing like a diet to bring out the comments. My mention of skipping meals brought me some contrasting reactions, divided equally between those who told me that it would make me fat, and those who said that it would be the start of the slippery slope to starving myself to death. Fortunately, as with most disaster scenarios, they can't all happen at once.The reality of the diet is that, in spite of my best efforts before and after the Velazquez exhibition (well worth seeing by the way) I had lost another pound this morning. That meant IÂ was 1 1/2 pounds under my target for the day. So now I have another day without any rules. Great! The choccy cake has run out, so I am now tucking in to scones with loads of jam.

There is nothing wrong with missing the odd meal. The "intermittent fasting" approach is growing in popularity with interesting science behind it:Try[http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/?p=278](http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/?p=278)or[http://stevemount.blogspot.com/2005/06/more-on-intermittent-fasting.html](http://stevemount.blogspot.com/2005/06/more-on-intermittent-fasting.html)or[http://www.arthurdevany.com/2006/12/intermittent_fa_2.html](http://www.arthurdevany.com/2006/12/intermittent_fa_2.html)

Thanks, Chris. I love the comment in the first article:"Going entirely without food in the short term leads to improvement in health, but also leads to an extremely short life unless the fast is aborted."

My rules have just started now. Must have been the chocolate cheesecake that did it. What happens if you end up with a no-eat day on Christmas?Wendy

Hi, Wendy. Funnily enough I was trying to answer just exactly that question this morning when I was writing my journal. My conclusion was that I would have to be very careful in the few days leading up to Christmas, so that I had no rules in place. The real crunch would come just about at New Year's Eve!Best of luck with the Diet. Please note that I have decided to reverse the order of the first two rules so that No Seconds is introduced before No Snacking.

I've added a new rule to my Christmas party noshing -- one of everything when I first arrive. Then, I will try to stay away from the food room for the rest of the evening, either by planting myself in a chair or mingling. I have so many trigger foods that it's best if I'm not in the same room with them.

Hi, Mike. I'm now on Day 5 of my modified No-S diet and I still have no rules at all. The weekend will be the crunch time!
