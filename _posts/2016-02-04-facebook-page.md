Does anyone know how to turn off the feature which shows a short extract when you post a link? Instead of extracting the main text, itâ€™s showing the right margin!

[Update: Problem now solved. Thanks!]

Once you post a link, the extract usually appears below the posting. Beneath the extract, there's usually an option called "hide preview". Click on that and it'll be gone. I think this only shows up if you're the author of the post.

Thanks, Erik. I think I've got it sorted the way I want now.
