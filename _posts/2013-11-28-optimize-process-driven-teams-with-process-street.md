(A guest post by Vinay Patankar of Process Street)

The key to success, when managing a business, is undoubtedly the productivity of your employees. Unfortunately, many businesses suffer from inefficient teams.

Getting down to the core of the problem can be as simple as bringing in a new tool or program to jumpstart the team’s attention and motivation. Process Street, is here to help. Bringing in the simplicity that is Process Street’s process management capabilities and the ability to join an entire crew into the project under one roof, optimizing your team is as easy as signing up.

If you’re running a business, you may have encountered various tools aimed at task management. These are tools such as Teambox, Asana and countless others. These are great for one off projects and tasks, but they don’t cater to tasks that happen on a recurring basis, whether frequent or in frequent.

Process Street takes it further by brining the project to life in a virtual business ecosystem, where everyone can see where their gears function in the whole of the project.

You may be asking, why is that important? Well, the reason is simple. Business executives have established that team members and employees, function better and offer better productivity when they can see how their actions and completed tasks affect the company.  For example, if you keep Bob, Mary, and Tom confined to their cubicles, and give them each a task list, at least one of them will be inclined to slack off thinking that “maybe” his job is not as important as it seems. In other words, someone else will get to it.

Under Process Street, everyone has a place, a purpose, and serves the cause in their own way. And luckily for the owner of Bob, Mary, and Tom’s company; Process Street offers a fully functional version of the tool absolutely free for up to 3 team members.

Pricing

For larger teams Process Street offers 4 convenient and cost effective brackets. For example, a team of 10 can use the tool for just $30 per month.

Teams of 20 and 50 can use the tool for $50 and $100 per month, respectively. And when it comes to SMEs, we all know the teams can expand greatly as the business flourishes. For these larger enterprises, Process Street allows you to call in and get a reasonable quote for your team.

Design and Functionality

Process Street makes the interface of the tool interactive and beautiful. Process Documents are broken down into tasks which can be checked off as staff complete them. The rich content interface includes rich media such as video and images to get the “big picture” across to the team, no pun intended.

But arguably, what makes Process Street different from the rest of the tools currently on the market, is it’s unique ability to track the completion of processes across the board. Under Process Street, as we mentioned before, everyone is responsible for something, and the team knows this. Managers can look into the tool and see who’s not working up to par, spot those inefficiencies that are holding the entire project back, and do something about it. Inefficiencies mean loss of money for the company, there is no other way to put it. Process Street ensures that money stays where it belongs; in your pocket.

The same concept breeds healthy competition, as the managers can also see who in the team is completing their tasks in a reasonable time frame. Process Street can become the epicenter of productivity, with employees vying for the monthly/ weekly prize offered to the most productive employee; that is of course if your enterprise offers such incentives. The competition can be as simple as just who gets to stay onboard.

Time Wasters

Many traditional enterprise owners refuse to believe that the majority of their wasted time comes from unnecessary meetings. That’s right. Often, a meeting needs to be called so that everyone can gather and get the new updated information issues on a change in standard operating procedures.

This can be a real problem for growing businesses who go through changes like babies go through diapers. All those meetings for minor changes can be eliminated with Process Street. The tool itself offers the ability to update processes, directly to the task list, and teams will get respective notifications on the application.

That means, there is no need to send out a mass email to the company (which probably won’t get read anyway). And since, most team members will have Process Street open all day, there are no excuses such as “I didn’t get the email”.

Process Street also allows Managers and SME owners to manage their processes from multiple organizations from one consolidated account, great for subsidiaries and different office locations.

We’ve seen task management a million times over. Process Street, is process management, complete with employee productivity, and inefficiency management. It works for the team, managers and the company as a whole, and soon will change the way SMEs do business altogether. Create a free account today and see for yourself.

I tried to sign up. It asks for my email address. I give it. It then presents a login screen, asking for email and password. I don't know my password. I wait, thinking the system will email me my first password. Nothing arrives. I click "I forgot my password", then enter my email. It says my email address is not registered in the system. I went through this twice. The sign up process appears to be broken.  
  
FWIW, I did all this on my phone.

Seraphim:  
  
I just checked whether it works. On both my phone (Android) and PC the site presents me with a huge box which asks for my email and "Create Free Account". It then takes me into the process of setting up an account and verifying my email address. I've just received an email with my password. It seems to be working perfectly for me.
