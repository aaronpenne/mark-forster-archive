It didn’t take me long to decide that this isn’t for me - at least not in the way I was trying to do it. I will have a think about a better way to organize it, and maybe have another go in a few days.

This may be good for personal stuff, but I wouldn't use it for business. Or at least never include business email content going to an outside company with no control.
