I’m setting myself a challenge of writing a blog post every day.

Why do that?

There are several reasons. The chief one is that I just feel like setting myself a challenge!

Lesser reasons include the fact that writing blog posts keeps one’s mind sharp. New thought comes out of engagement.

Then I want to explore a bit further some of the themes in my book “Secrets of Productive People”.

I also want to have a vehicle to report progress on some of the other challenges I’ve set myself recently.

And not quite finally, I’m beginning to get ideas for another book - and want to be able to write out some of my early thoughts.

And finally finally, I’m using a new time management method which I want to test out. It’s designed to provide the consistent, regular, focused attention which is the key to success in any field of activity. More about this in subsequent posts.

Looking forward to reading your posts again. I find your explanation of the development and refinement of your systems as useful as the systems themselves. It helps me be a better observer and assessor of my own working process.

I agree with this 100%. Mark has helped me to think more logically, laterally, linearly, clearly, creatively, and simply. He's a teacher, inventor, mad scientist, coach, writer, and cool cat of the first order. And more importantly, he knows exactly how a cream tea should be made.
