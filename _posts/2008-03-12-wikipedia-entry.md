I’ve just discovered that I have a Wikipedia entry!

I wonder how long that’s been there?

October last year apparently.

And who wrote it?

“Wirefree” - no other details.

The writer’s done a reasonable job but there are a few inaccuracies.

Never mind!

Hi Mark  
  
Did you know you can edit your Wikipedia entry to correct the inaccuracies. (There's a little edit link at the bottom right corner of the entry) Best to register with the site or it displays your IP address for all and sundry to see - well, so it says - I haven't played around with Wikipedia myself just read its blurb...  
  
Hope that helps anyway.

Yes, I do know. I've edited several Wikipedia articles. But somehow editing one's own doesn't seem quite right!  
  
Actually the one that really needs editing is the one on Time Management. That's a complete mess.

You're correct that you shouldn't really edit your own entry: bad Wikipedia etiquette. But if you click on "discussion" on your article, you could leave a note on the talk page, suggesting some changes (and providing links to published sources, if possible, which seems silly, given that you're the ultimate authority on yourself — but such is Wikipedia...)
