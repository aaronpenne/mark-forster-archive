There are now 18 reviews of Do It Tomorrow on amazon.co.uk and all of them are five-star.A few extracts:“It’s simple, profound and it works”“helped me to find the peace of mind I have been searching for this year”“I strongly advise reading his terrific little book - you won’t be disappointed”“The really big thing for me was how much calmer it made me”“I have read Mark’s first book, which I thought was excellent, but this book is absolutely superb”To read the reviews or order the book, click here
