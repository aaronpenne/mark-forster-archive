It’s taken longer than I expected but I have now finished Part 2 of Napoleon the Great by Andrew Roberts. Before starting the third and final part, I will aim to read some shorter books, starting with The Military Philosophers by Anthony Powell.

I’ve so far stuck to my rule to read only one book at a time, and have finished the following since January 24th:

The Evolution of Everything by Matt Ridley.

The Valley of Bones by Anthony Powell

Napoleon the Great (parts 1 and 2) by Andrew Roberts

In Parenthesis by David Jones

The Soldier’s Art by Anthony Powell
