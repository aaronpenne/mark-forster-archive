I finished Day 1 of my experiment on reducing caffeine consumption having established a benchmark of 19 cups of tea - yes, you did read that right: 19 cups of tea.

Frankly this morning I find the idea of having to consume 19 cups of tea today revolting in the extreme. So perhaps the technique is working!

Urgh! Nearly 4 o’clock and I’ve still got another nine cups of tea to go.

The things I put myself through for my readers!
