An former client has just sent me a review of Do It Tomorrow from the currentÂ issue of Business Life. Quite a good review: four stars out of five. Short extract:"So is the book worth spending time on?""Absolutely. Forster writes in an amiable, engaging way and makes plenty of telling points about the way we fail to make the most of our time at work."
