Just to remind you that the Lenten Challenge starts on Wednesday next week. So if you haven’t already signed up, please make sure you do so before the Challenge starts. Best to do it now in case you forget - late entries will not be accepted.

Similarly if you’ve already signed up but want to change the method you have registered, don’t forget to let me know before the start of the Challenge.

I think the list is complete, but if anyone has been missed out, please let me know as soon as possible.

You can sign on or amend your entry either by email (see right tab on top menu) or by comment box (it doesn’t matter which post you put your comment on - I see all new comments together).

Please amend my method from Flexible Autofocus to "own method".  
  
If it works for the Lenten challenge I will post about it.  
  
Thanks

Glad I started a few days early, staying consistent is needing some practice. Getting better, but still slipping.

Please change mine to be Every-Other-Day rather than Daily, since that's what I'll probably do.  
  
Also, will we do updates, and if so, how? Thread per week? Thread per participant? Thread per type of system?

Put me down for simple scanning.

I will probably issue reminders during the Challenge to let me know if one has not succeeded in sticking to one's system.

Please count me in too, Mark. I am using my own system, which includes a form of fv/simple scans along with mini habits.

Should we distinguish between falling off the wagon (and climbing back on again) and abandoning the wagon?

Count me in. I'll be using AF4-3T.

Count me in, too. I'll be using the "reviewing an old favourite" method from November 18th, starting with a new list tomorrow.

Please count me in with T7P10, a system I developed during the last year. T7P10 uses a combination of a weekbased task journal and some index cards for bigger projects.

No, if you fall off the wagon you have failed the challenge. There's nothing to stop you re-starting again of course - but not as part of the challenge.

So does my goal of reviewing status every other day fit? I won't meet every day, but not missing two days in a row might be doable. (I'm going to keep it as a personal challenge, even if it doesn't qualify for the official one.)
