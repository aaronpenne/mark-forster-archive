I’ve posted several times that I am nearing completion of the development of the Final Version, and each time further problems have surfaced and the completion has been put off. This hasn’t been a question of procrastination - simply of getting it right.

So rather than post yet again to say that I feel I’m nearly there, I thought I’d give you some indicators so that you can tell for yourself how near I’m getting.

Watch out for these:

I’m not saying that all of these will necessarily happen, but when you see several of these signs then you will know that the day is nigh!

Until you do, you can be pretty sure that it isn’t.

- Daily blog posts

- Revival and reorganization of my newsletter

- A reduction in my personal activity on the Discussion Forum.

- Changes to the website

- A new programme of seminars

- New initiatives (such as videos, teleconferences, partnerships, etc)

- An increase in external interest

Mark,  
  
Autofocus this, superforcus that, final solution, no really the \*final\* solution, honest, I'm nearly there, I'm \*really\* nearly there, I'm, ....  
  
There comes a point where repeated failed attempts to solve a problem should lead the thoughtful person to conclude that the failure lies in their specification not of the solution but of the problem.  
  
Don't you think you have now reached that point?

It's the journey \*and\* the destination. Enjoy the journey.

According to the inventor of WD-40, "WD" stands for "Water Dispersal" and "40" is the number of attempts he made at the formula before he got it right.

<<An increase in external interest>>  
  
Does that mean:  
  
1. there will be increased interest in Mark's work from people who are new to his website, or  
  
2. Mark will have increased interest in activities other than his website?

It means that you may see more mentions of my work on other websites, etc, because I will be publicizing it.

"A new programme of seminars"  
  
I thought you were retired, Mark! I'm sure they'll be good, though.  
  
And so far, this one hasn't happened either:  
  
 "A reduction in my personal activity on the Discussion Forum."  
  
;-)  
  
Looking forward to judgement day!

I had not checked into this website for a long time until I received the email this morning. Very much looking forward to the new book and I hope there is a US release so that I can pick it up from Amazon.  
All the best,  
Josh
