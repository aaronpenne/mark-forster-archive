John McConnel, a stress management trainer and coach, has sent me a useful checklist for having a great 2008. You can read it and/or download it by clicking here.

He is happy for you to make what use you like of it as long as you attribute it to him.

Hi Mark, I think the link may be broken. It doesn't work on my Mac using either Safari 3 or Firefox browsers.

It's an MS-Word .doc file, which may be a problem for a Mac to download.  
  
Otherwise the link works fine for me on both Internet Explorer and Firefox.  
  
Anyone else having a problem?

i randomly dropped in here from <http://www.businessofdesignonline.com/time-management-ring-fence/> - thanks for the checklist!  
  
something someone once told me that i found quite valuable and would like to share: "you can't save time; you can only spend it more wisely" - i found that one well worth thinking about :)

Hi Mark  
I don't have Word. Is there a way to read the article online? If so, would you kindly offer the link?. I'm already assuming it's worth a read, because YOU mentioned it!

Here's the text:  
  
  
How To Make 2008 Great!  
   
  
If you want to make 2008 one of the great years of your life you will need:   
  
  
\* a clear vision of the life you would like to be living by the end of the year  
  
  
\* some goals to help you achieve your vision  
  
  
\* an awareness of your strengths and weaknesses to help you on your way  
  
  
\* an ability to focus your attention and use your thoughts, feelings, words and actions in a way that brings benefit to yourself and others  
  
  
\* the courage and determination to put into practice for at least 21 days any changes you want to make.  
   
  
Bearing this in mind, take time out to relax and create a reflective mood in which to answer the following questions:  
   
  
1. In what ways would you like your life to be different by the end of 2008?  
   
  
2. If you were to choose an overall theme (for example, happiness) to give the year more structure and direction what would it be?  
   
  
3. What drains and/or blocks your energy? How can you change this?  
   
  
4. Name three changes in your consumption habits that would help improve your health.  
   
  
5. What regular physical exercise will you commit to this year?  
   
  
6. What improvements would you like to make in your personal relationships?  
   
  
7. Name three ways in which you could economise. What will you do with the money that you save?  
   
  
8. How can you become more ‘time-rich’ both at home and at work? What will you do with the time that you save?  
   
  
9. How can you make your work more enjoyable and stress-free?  
   
  
10. Think of the qualities of someone you really admire and respect. How can you develop those qualities more in yourself?  
   
  
11. Name three ways in which you will care more for yourself this year.  
   
  
12. What will you do to nurture your inner spirit?  
   
  
13. If you had one wish for the world that could be granted, what would it be? How can you help make that wish come true?  
   
  
14. What is the single most important change you could make to improve the quality of your life?

Hi, Matthew  
  
It's still working for me, using exactly the same combination as you. So I have no idea what's causing the problem. Very annoying!  
  
Anyway the text is above so, if you want to download it, just copy and paste it.

I'm sure that someone posted information re a good website for page a day diaries, but ordering a single copy in February has proved tricky! I'd be grateful for a suggestion. Web browsing for a suitable site has used up too much valuable time!

FlickB:  
Where are you based? Most stationers in UK are selling them off cheaply at the moment. I bought mine at Staples for £2.49.   
  
Alternatively Amazon UK is selling one for £2.48 at <http://www.amazon.co.uk/burgundy-diary-format-ribbon-bookmark/dp/B000V3IB52/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1203681510&sr=8-1>

Thanks Mark. I can't think how I missed the one on Amazon. I'll order one today. Your books are very motivating. I've just started reading 'Do it tomorrow' - again.
