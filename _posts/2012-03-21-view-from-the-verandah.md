This is the view from the verandah (when itâ€™s not raining) as I work on The Final Version in the depths of the Australian outback.

Yeah, stunning. But whenever I think of the Australian outback, I worry about critters: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_funnel-web_spider>

The main worry here at the moment is floods.

Thanks for sharing that, Mark. I hope you're enjoying your visit to Queensland.

Hope you're enjoying our beautiful Queensland weather, Mark. Don't worry, the water will stop rising ... eventually. It looks at this stage like this year's floods won't be as bad as the ones we had last year, so fear not -- you will be able to escape!  
  
@avrum: Don't worry too much about spiders, snakes, etc, should you ever visit us down under. The main things to be concerned about in Australia are heart disease and automobile accidents, just like anywhere else in the developed world :-)

Looks really beautiful - I bet you will find it hard to leave and come home - not just because of the view either - it must be wonderful to spend time with family that you don't get to see very often.

Things I don't miss in the Queensland outback:  
  
Airplanes  
Wind farms  
Cyclists  
Communications installations on the top of every hill  
Parking charges  
Light pollution  
  
Things I miss in the Queensland outback:  
  
Roads with bends  
English pubs  
Public footpaths  
Being able to get somewhere else in less than 40 minutes  
  
Things I love in the Queensland outback:  
  
Space  
Friendliness  
Being able to see the stars - all of them!
