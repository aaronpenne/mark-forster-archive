Now that weâ€™ve got back into our own house and life is gradually returning to something like normal - at least for a bit - I intend to start blogging again. It will probably be more sporadic than it was over the past year.I intend to start with another post on the subject of randomness v. procrastination. Coming soon!

Hi Mark - I've been away from internet connection all month and now that I'm back I was shocked and saddened to hear that your cancer has returned. However, I'm not at all shocked or surprised that you'll be continuing to blog - that's typical of your generosity in sharing your ideas with this online community. You are an absolute inspiration, as others have said.Very best wishes.
