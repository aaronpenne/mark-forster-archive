Now that weâ€™ve got back into our own house and life is gradually returning to something like normal - at least for a bit - I intend to start blogging again. It will probably be more sporadic than it was over the past year.

I intend to start with another post on the subject of randomness v. procrastination. Coming soon!

Hi Mark - I've been away from internet connection all month and now that I'm back I was shocked and saddened to hear that your cancer has returned. However, I'm not at all shocked or surprised that you'll be continuing to blog - that's typical of your generosity in sharing your ideas with this online community. You are an absolute inspiration, as others have said.   
  
Very best wishes.
