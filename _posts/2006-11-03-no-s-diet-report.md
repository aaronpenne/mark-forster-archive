I weighed myself this morning and found that I had lost 7 lbs in all. This is exactly the same as when I weighed myself last a couple of weeks ago. To be fair, I had an exceptionally heavy weekend at the end of last week - with a wedding, a family lunch party and two visits to a restaurant with friends. Since they all were on "S Days" the rules didn't apply.  My life isn't usually anything like as social as that, so I don't normally go mad at weekends. If it hadn't been for that exceptional two days I might well have lost another one or two pounds.Excuses of course are what dieting is all about - but the great thing about this diet is that I don't have to feel guilty about last weekend because I had in fact stuck to the rules.My original intention was not to weigh myself until the month was up. If I'd kept to that intention, I would have been delighted that I'd lost 7 lbs in a month. As it is the delight is muted by the knowledge that all the loss happened at the start.This is not intended to be a quickie diet. It is there for the long-term so I intend to stick to it. I've found it easy to keep to, and the results so far have been good. I'll do some follow-up reports to show how I get on.You can read all about the "No S Diet" at www.nosdiet.com

Look on the bright side - with all the socializing, you'd probably have gained if you weren't doing this!(BTW, I found the No-S from your first post - it's been working very well for me. Thanks!!!!)
