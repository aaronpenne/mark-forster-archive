Using my latest method, which is designed to be a High Intensity Use of Time, I have done 94 tasks out of 149 in the last 24 hours with 55 tasks remaining on the list, mostly re-entries.

During the day I was absent at a pub lunch with friends for four hours.

I experienced no resistance, got everything of importance done (and everything of lesser importance too). And instead of feeling exhausted, I have been getting steadily more energetic throughout the day.

By the time I went to bed less than four hours after posting the above I had done a further 30 tasks with 59 remaining on the list.

Sounds impressive!  
Out if interest, if you had used the simple scanning method, would you have completed the same number of tasks? I.e. What improvements do you envisage?  
Can't wait for the new method.....

No, this is much faster and more enjoyable than any system I've used before.
