I couldn’t believe my eyes this morning when I weighed in and found that I was 2 lbs below my target weight for the day. That means that since I introduced the Ratchet Effect on March 10th I have lost 6 lbs. That’s nearly 2 lbs per week. Although I am eating much less than I used to in my pre-diet days, I have not been feeling particularly hungry. That seems to me to mean that my body is adjusting quite well to my weight loss.
