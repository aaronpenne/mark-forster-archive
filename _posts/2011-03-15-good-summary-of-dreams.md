Israel Keys has put a good short summary of my book How to Make Your Dreams Come True on his blog. The book is available free of charge on this website.

Hi Mark,  
  
How to make your dreams come true sounds great. I'm particularly interested in the goal achievement methodology.  
  
The link to the book you posted doesn't appear to work. Any chance you could doublecheck it?  
  
(By the way, I am finding Super Focus really effective, and your post on how to use Column 2 was extremely timely!)

I finished \_Dreams\_ a little while ago, and it was excellent!  
  
Mark's link above works for me, but you can also find it in his blog post here:  
<http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/29/how-to-make-your-dreams-come-true.html>  
  
Plenty of authors have suggested writing out your future vision and then following various daily techniques to move toward it, but what sets Mark's method apart is the way it integrates that "other" part of you: the part that would rather be napping, eating ice cream, or checking your email one more time.  
  
Most authors quixotically fight your inner trouble-maker with various measures of iron discipline that are obviously going to fail sooner or later, but Mark invites it to the bargaining table, where you will likely find that it has something to say, something that actually improves your vision until the vision appeals to \*all\* of you at once. Then you are in Pull Mode, and there is no stopping you!  
  
\_Dreams\_ paints a compelling picture of all this and provides simple, flexible steps for pursuing it through self coaching. Reading it filled me with excited thoughts of "I could really do this!" and "This could really, actually work!" So far, I have merely written "Start Dreams method" in my SuperFocus Column One, and as SF gradually carves some breathing room out of my backlog, I eagerly await the day that \_Dreams\_ will "stand out."

Mark - you have set comments to 'off' for the experiment blogs - this may be why you haven't had any entries!
