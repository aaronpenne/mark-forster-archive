I’ve been going for less than a day with this and already the results are very encouraging.

At the moment I’ve got five pages of 33 lines each and the stats are:

Page 1: 33 done, 0 remaining

Page 2: 26 done, 7 remaining

Page 3: 5 done, 28 remaining

Page 4: 2 done, 31 remaining

Page 5: 0 done, 15 remaining

—————————————————

Total:   66 done, 81 remaining

===================

As you can see it is a characteristic of this system that it is weighted towards the beginning of the list.

Perhaps the most important thing to report is that the 5-4-3-2-1 method didn’t let me down once.

Those who want to have a go at this for themselves please note that I introduced a new rule:

If you come to a single task which can’t be done at the precise time that you come to it (e.g. time of day, weather, etc), it should be left in place for a subsequent pass.
