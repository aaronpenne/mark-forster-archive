If you’ve ever found that sometimes you forget to re-enter a recurring or uncompleted task at the end of a long list, then here’s the solution.

It all lies in the order in which you do these three actions:

1) Select the next task

2) Dot it

3) Do it

4) Re-enter it

But if you do them in that order, then you are running a risk of forgetting action 4) re-entering the task.

It’s far better to do them in this order:

1) Select the next task

2) Re-enter it

3) Dot it

4) Do it

If you are using a pre-dotted system like FVP, then just re-enter the task before you start working on it.

If you do it like this, you will never forget to re-enter a task again.

I can't say this has really been a problem for me, not that I never forget. The solution doesn't suit me anyway in my chosen digital medium. I don't scratch off done tasks, I send them to the end. If I did that before doing the work, I would lose my spot in the list because it's no longer there!

As you say, it's easy to forget to re-enter a task. I do re-entering in this order:  
  
1) Select task.  
2) Dot it  
3) Re-enter it  
4) Do it  
  
 When I was re-entering as the last step, I felt I had to remind myself that I wasn't there to add a new task, only to do a re-entry. For some reason, doing it in the order above means my focus is on going back to the task I've just selected, not having reached the end of the list.

Margaret1:  
  
The only problem I could see happening with the order you do it in is that dotting a task is usually done just before doing it. So you may sometimes find yourself doing it, rather than re-entering it. Especially if you've been used to doing it in the order 1) Select the next task 2) Dot it 3) Do it 4) Re-enter it.   
  
But if it works fine for you stick to it.

Thanks Mark - yes, it works for me. Dotting the task helps me find it again easily when I've done the re-entering. In fact, I actually do a double dot - that stands out even more. Another thing I've started doing is to use a bright highlighter pen for items I've worked on, rather than crossing them out. The unhighlighted tasks are easier to find, and if I want to check back through what I've worked on, it's easier to read than when it's crossed out.
