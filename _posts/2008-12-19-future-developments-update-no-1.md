How have I been getting on with the new time management method that I blogged about yesterday? The answer is extremely well. I’ve deliberately been throwing everything I can at it to see how easy it is to overwhelm the system - and so far I haven’t succeeded in overwhelming it at all.

I started testing the system about half-way through Wednesday (17th) and so far have actioned 193 tasks, which works out at approximately 77 tasks per day. At present I have 50 active tasks (including writing this posting).

More soon!

(Phew! only 49 tasks to go!)

This I can't wait to hear more about! You may recall from an earlier post that I am a recent convert to GDT (about 6 weeks) and although I have wobbled a bit I am hugely impressed with the effect that it is having on my life. There are times however when just the sheer volume of tasks/deadlines and responsibilities to manage make the number of tasks feel overwhelming, If you have identified a way to deal with the sort of level you've noted above that would be truly a gift.  
  
Good luck and happy to help in a beta test. Best wishes for christmas and the new year.

Hi Mark,  
  
This sounds great! I wait in anticipation to see your new system -- and as I said before, I will be glad to serve as a Beta-tester -- to see if my workload can overload your system!  
  
Best wishes,  
-David
