I’ve been working my new system now for three days. So here are the statistics as at the end of Day 3 for each active page that I have now. The first figure is the number of task remaining unactioned on the page. The second figure (in brackets) is the total number on the page.

Feb 6.  2 (36)

Feb 7. 10 (46)

Feb 8.  23 (40)

Feb 28. 27 (99)

Mar 1. 4 (24)

Totals: 66 (244)

Bear in mind that because of the short month, Feb 28 was open to new entries for two days.

Feb 29? No such thing. Better move stuff to Mar 1.

Whoops! that was a mistake. I meant Mar 1. I've now corrected it.
