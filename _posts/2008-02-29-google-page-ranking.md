I’m delighted to see that this blog has been promoted back up to a Google page ranking of 5, having been a 4 for most of the last year.

Google’s PageRank assigns each website on the internet a number between 1 and 10, representing a relative importance factor (in the eyes of Google). This number is determined by the number of credible links to your site that Google can identify. The higher your site’s PageRank is, the more precedence your site is given within search queries on terms that your site references — it’s your credibility rating with Google. Most sites on the internet have a PageRank 0. It becomes exponentially harder to move up in PageRank as the numbers increase. For example, there are only around 25 or so websites with PageRank 10.

According to the Google Backlink facility, there are around 235 sites linking to this blog.
