For those of you who are having trouble understanding Beeminder, here’s Bethany to explain it all. It’s worth also reading the written explanation given on Youtube.

Gorsh, I'm practically famous! I'm surprised by how many things are out of date in that video already. Also, I used 'bethany' for my username for example purposes, but my real gallery is at beeminder.com/b if anyone is interested.

Btw, the "written explanation on youtube" is a near word-for-word transcription of the video.

Thank you Mark and Beeminders. I've been following Mark's various posts on the subject and reviewing the website.   
  
From a layperson's viewpoint, I think beeminder has got the underlying psychology and motivational aspects to goal setting and achievement very well thought out and researched. I think I'm about ready to jump in myself.

I \*love\* the rose-colored dots!! What a great idea. For about a week now, I've been tracking a couple of goals in Beeminder, and the whole process is feeling good and working surprisingly well.  
Thanks, Bethany & Daniel et al for a great tool.  
And thanks, Mark, for sharing it with us on your site.

Why is she laughing throughout? I thought it a bit annoying, as if she couldn't take her own product seriously.

JT,  
<<Why is she laughing throughout?>>  
  
I found it to-die-for cute but decided not to mention it at the time. As a former 20-something midnight hacker myself, I'm glad to see our tech startups haven't lost their personality.

Oh come on folks, Beeminder is HIGH-larious business. And so is my co-founder making silly faces at me behind the camera :-)

When I get back from Australia (mid-April), I am going to get going again with some really serious Beeminder challenges. Really!
