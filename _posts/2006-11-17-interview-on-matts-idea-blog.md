There's a long write up of an interview with me by Matthew Cornell in Matt's Idea Blog: A Conversation with Mark Forster

Matt's a great interviewer and writer, and he has given me a chance to be a bit more wide ranging than I'm usually able to be in interviews. So if you want my ideas on a whole host of business and life subjects summed up very neatly, this is a good place to start.

Mark, I was introduced to you and your work by that Cornell blog entry.   
  
I have since looked over your web site articles and just today received your latest book! (...delivered by Royal Mail from Amazon.UK to me here in cold Minnesota, USA). I look forward to reviewing and implementing.   
  
Your "I'll Just Get the File Out" trick has already reaped some benefits here.  
  
Take Care, -DP
