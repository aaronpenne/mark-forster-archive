0800. The list is divided into two unequal parts, divided by a line ———————. Different rules apply to each part. I am starting where I left off yesterday, near the end of the list. The method here is to move down the list taking action on those tasks which feel ready to be done. I will number tasks in the order they are done so you can follow the sequence. The numbers in brackets after some tasks are times, and refer to the log entries at the end of the list (of which this is the first).

0833. This is reminding me why I hate using electronic means of working a to do list! It’s slowing me down no end. The Squarespace editor is also being annoying - a blank line has appeared in the middle of the list which I don’t seem to be able to get rid of. Never mind!

0904. I’ve now reached the end of the list. My next action is to go to the beginning of the list - into the part of the list before the line (——————). Oooooerrrr!!!

1018. Within the first part of the list, I keep circling round the list until nothing further seems ready to do.

1053. I’ve now been round the first part of the list three times, and there’s nothing further that seems ready to do. So now I start on the second part of the list. I only do one pass of this before going back to the first part.

1450. Now reached the end of the list for the second time today. So back to the first part of the list (the “backlog”)

1452. None of the tasks in the “backlog” stand out for action so I have marked them all up for review (on paper I would have used a highlighter for this). At the same time I have drawn a line at the end of the list so that the whole current list becomes the “backlog”. All new tasks will now go below this line.

1528. Now reached the end of the list for the third time today. Notice how fast I moved through the list this time. Back to the beginning of the list.

1534. What I have now done is delete all the items marked for review. You will see that I have re-entered some after rephrasing them. One I have re-entered as it was (A recorded TV program that I haven’t yet had time to see). The rest I have dropped altogether because I decided the time wasn’t yet ripe for them.

1709. Reached end of first part of list - back to the beginning. On another subject, this page has been loaded 5,973 times today (and it wasn’t all by me!)

1847 End of first part of list again - back to beginning.

1849 I’ve been round the first part of the list again without any tasks seeming ready to do - so on to the second part.

2046. Page has been accessed 7,507 times today.

2057 Reached the end of the list again. Back to the beginning. I’ll select a next task, but what I’m really going to do is go and watch NCIS on tv!

2300 That’s it for today. 70 tasks completed. 8,604 page views. I hope that’s given everyone a good idea of how powerful the system is. Now I’ve just got to copy everything I’ve done today back into my paper notebook!

There is a brilliant file by Andreas Hofmann which gives an animated version of this demonstration. This is an absolute must for quick understanding of the system. Many thanks, Andreas, this was a huge undertaking.

I guess placing that line is one of the most important parts of AF4. So I'm really curious to read the rule.

Since Facebook is on your list, which Mark Forster there are you? I didn't see you in the search results I looked through. There is a Mark Forster in the Autofocus Group, but he ... doesn't look anything like you. My profile is here: <http://www.facebook.com/andreas.michael.hofmann>

It goes at the end of the whole list when the previous "backlog" is completed. So three days ago that line included the whole list.

Hi Mark  
It's 4:14 am here......I'm drugged and riding out the pain via your live blog. Thanks for the entertainment. The tv only has junk shows and infomercials. I have my music going also. Because I'm still grateful to not have a backlog since you bailed me out of mine a few years ago......I'm am curious as to how you define a backlog these days.....  
  
You stated:

Because I work from a weekly format, I'm shocked that you define work less than 3 days old as a backlog! LOL! How do you define it? Even DIT standards allowed up to 4 days to catch up on the loose ends!

Is "task marked for review" the same as "tasks on notice" or "tasks on review"?

Hi Mark,  
  
Good morning - and what a good idea to try this here. It would be really useful if you can explain in your running commentary today the rules that you are following, and anything that crops up around why you do and don't do certain tasks. Without knowing what the new process is that you are following it is difficult to appreciate how and why the list is being covered. Also why and how there are two lists, or two parts to the list.  
  
Regards,  
Jonathan

Perhaps that is the reason Mark prefers not to call it a backlog.

I presume (based on what Mark has said previously) that the completed tasks are only being shown for our benefit - and are not part of the system.  
  
It's fascinating then that Mark is doing all of this electronically. Looks like you could run the whole system within a single electronic note...or even a standard, simple task list as long as you can move the line up and down within it.

Good Morning Andreas H.  
This is quite fun....given my options...\*blush\*....  
This is precisely the reason I couldn't follow DIT. I'm a great proponent of planning my weekly outcomes and that necessitates me ignoring the trivia while I'm focused on other work. I'd go completely bonkers if I had to follow the dictates of random stuff streaming in to decide how I spend my limited resources. Even before I was disabled and had a far more rigorous schedule (I lived out of my calendar for ambitious pursuits, competitions and social life and totally off list for my pleasures and passions) Even then, I ignored the trivia unless I had dead space time...(small units of time between important aims or events)   
Even though I was quite ambitious, my Bohemian spirit prevailed ultimately. If it was important enough, it put on the calendar. If not, it had to wait until I had dead time.....and I was intent on having very little of that! LOL!   
Perhaps, this is why I had such a hard time adjusting my lifestyle to my limitations....It's cruel folly for me to aim very high these days! \*blush\* My energy and attitude would be severly hampered if I had to chase down backlogs that were less than 3 days old! LOL!  
  
BTW.....how is your back healing? I sincerely hope that you are enjoying better times.

Hi Andreas  
Maybe he has to put it in the post to return it.....Netflix or an equivalent....my sister loves her Netflix.....I can't follow movies without backtracking them over and over. My short term memory limitations can't hold the characters or plot! \*blush\* Therefore, I rarely attempt to watch a movie unless it seems like it would be worth hours and hours of effort to follow it. The last one I watched was Johnny Cash's bio. It was called "Walk the Line"....yes...it was worth it!

Fascinating! Better than a webcam, I'd say... ;-)  
  
I suppose the dismissal rule will be that once you enter the backlog and find no task standing out in the first pass-though, you dismiss the whole backlog and draw the new divider line below the open list.  
  
This is... awesome! Makes RAF looking old and clunky.

Hi Learning, must be something different, because he re-added it. Or he put it in an envelope and when he next comes to it, he'll put stamp on it or mail it.  
  
Well, perhaps it's not the most important aspect to pay attention to. ;-)  
  
Does the cycling through the backlog (what \*do\* you prefer to call it, Mark?) work like cycling through a page in AF1/Forward Mode? If you do a complete pass without actioning anything, you leave the backlog?

"I suppose the dismissal rule will be that once you enter the backlog and find no task standing out in the first pass-though, you dismiss the whole backlog and draw the new divider line below the open list."  
  
HOLY MOLY! Are you asserting that everything above today's italicized entries would become the new backlog?   
And what is the fate of the original backlog items?....or does it all become an even bigger lump or............scary thought..........the current backlog gets dismissed?  
That sounds like lightening speed! A mid day nap or an impromptu social visit could throw off the whole thing! LOL! WAY too fast for the like of me! LOL!

Just in case anyone's interested, the SiteDelta addon for Firefox works really well for watching this live experiment - makes it very obvious how Mark is working the list.

I would guess not....not having a consequence of not acting on it procedurally would be too willy nilly.....His recent blog posts and comments infer that he's incorporating more procedural discipline into the new system to ensure progress and prevent willful avoidance/neglect.

"I suppose the dismissal rule will be that once you enter the backlog and find no task standing out in the first pass-though, you dismiss the whole backlog and draw the new divider line below the open list."  
  
I think that would be too drastic...probably dismissing whatever is left at the end of the day might be better...though even that is pretty drastic.

Hi Frank  
I totally concur with your sentiments!.......but then again, he's working off his list from 8am to 11pm..................that's PLENTY of time to knock out quite a bit of work! He has stated previously that he almost lives out of his list. Therefore, it's hard for me to guess how he's thinking. My goal is to get myself OUT of my list ASAP each day! I'll have to defer to your AF knowledge and experience in these matters.

**Author:** AndreasE
**Date:** 2009-09-04

I don't find this drastic. You might very well work on a backlog (=the part of the list ABOVE the divider line) several days. You just have to find anything in it to work on.  
  
But "dismiss it if on the first pass no task stands out" would be a very AF-like rule.

---

**Author:** AndreasE
**Date:** 2009-09-04

>>Are you asserting that everything above today's italicized entries would become the new backlog?<<  
  
No. The whole second part of the list will become the backlog the moment the momentary backlog gets dismissed.   
  
That's only my assumption, of course.

Hey Learning,  
  
I scored a copy of "The West Wing" (the pilot episode) if you are interested. I have not done more than that (i.e. find an upload site where I could place it so you could download it at your leisure) in case you are not interested upon further reflection.  
  
However, if you are, send an email with your email address to my new dummy email address:  
  
Erik.Satie@softhome.net  
  
and I'll work out the details. (I was in a fit of musical whimsy when I made that one up! ;-) I've done it before so it should not be a big deal.  
  
Fun stuff, this watching Mark go about his routine. It gives an interesting insight into how the world looks to him. He certainly DOES put everything on his list. LOL ;-)

Andreas,  
  
I wonder if it would be more likely that a new backlog would not be declared until the next day. That is what I would do. I can't see including an item I just wrote on the bottom of the list a minute ago to be part of a "backlog". But then, Mark has said he is not calling it a "backlog" so that may be why he might do something like that. Sometimes terminology is king ;-)

@AndreasE,  
  
"I don't find this drastic. You might very well work on a backlog (=the part of the list ABOVE the divider line) several days. You just have to find anything in it to work on."  
  
In Mark's comment at 10.53, he states he did not find anything to work on above-the-line...and he didn't dismiss the above-the-line tasks.  
  
I was suspecting that Mark would put everything above the line on review at the beginning of the day (to be dismissed the day after). But he didn't start off with anything in review, so that seems to negate that theory.

---

**Author:** Jacqueline
**Date:** 2009-09-04

Hey learning,   
It's that everything that he's doing in 15 hours are things I'd like to do too - but only have about 3 hours to do it in. Because I'm not retired with no kids.   
I think most people that have a full time job and families have to figure out what their priorities are.   
  
Mike, I'm worried that he's not eating though. Maybe today is a fasting day?

<<In Mark's comment at 10.53, he states he did not find anything to work on above-the-line...and he didn't dismiss the above-the-line tasks.>>  
  
Yes, but he did action several tasks above the line before that pass. So it could still be like a AF1 page. No action on first pass -> dismiss, no action on later pass -> leave backlog.   
  
I have a feeling we won't see any dismissing today.  
  
Re SiteDelta: Yes, it's really great for this. I primed it yesterday to watch the blog area and I also told it to keep backup copies of the changes. So I can go back in time and watch it step by step.

What I like so far is that it really removes emphasis from working on the latest and loudest in that the recently added tasks are only passed once. That was the greatest flaw with AF2/RAF in my eyes.
