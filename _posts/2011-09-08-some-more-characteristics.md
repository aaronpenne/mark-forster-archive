Hereâ€™s some more characteristics of the Final Version which I wrote down more or less at random while working the system today:

All these things happen naturally in response to your rate of work, psychological readiness and time available. There are no imposed quotas or limits.

- The system is self-regulating in that it adjusts the amount of work in the system to the amount of time available to do it.

- There is a built in check on the number of urgent tasks.

- It quickly removes projects which are going nowhere from the system.

- Only active stuff remains in the system.

- There is one very clear condition about when tasks that have been removed from the system can be re-entered.

- The number of daily recurring tasks is kept under control.

This almost sounds too good to be true! Mark, do you have an idea when you will release this new system?

Good to hear from you again.  
  
It will be later rather than sooner - because I want this one to be absolutely right.

How does it handle nasty tasks that you don't want to do, but need to be done?

Oh Mark--  
  
Your strength has become your weakness on this one. Please beware this trap you've set for yourself.  
  
"because I want it to be absolutely right." If that is the case, we will never see it.  
  
You've been down this path before having thought AF1 or another version was "right."  
  
Some versions already made will continue to be "absolutely right" for those who like using them.   
  
Absolutely right is a very vague phantom to chase and one that you can never catch. What are some objectives you desire to accomplish related to this system before you release it? Is that a realistic goal? In your desire for absolute correctness, is that becoming an excuse to avoid possible disagreements on the system that is currently working very well for you?  
  
I love the work you do too much to let you hide with this phantom goal of "absolutely right."  
  
Robert

Well, I know how to get around that one. Next Q&A, I'll be asking my Future Self to spill the beans.

Get someone else to do them for you.

You're absolutely right, Robert.

You might do better to ask mine.

Perhaps, Mark, if you're keeping the system hush for a while you could discuss principles or some such? Just a friendly wish.

Mark,  
Re: asking your Future Self for the low-down on your new system,  
I don't think I'm the best person to do that, so I hereby delegate that task to you. ;)  
I will look in next week to see how you are getting on with that.

Getting this system right is the first and least significant (but necessary) step in a five-stage vision.

Hi Mark,  
  
Like giving salt to a horse to make it drink. You make think about your new system often now.  
Any Release date ?  
Like most of us I'm ready to be a beta tester if you need one :)

To second Alan's suggestion, an occasional discussion of key principles of your new system would be most welcome, even if you're keeping the details of the whole system under wraps at the moment. Otherwise each post just builds up the suspense! 8-)

Very good idea, IMHO.
