Hi Mark,  
  
I'm wondering whether you may release the Final Version this month.  
  
Thanks,  
Box

I'm in desparate need of a todo/time management system and have been holding off trying out SuperFocus in anticipation of the Final Version.   
  
I bought and got a lot out of "Do It Tomorrow", but have fallen off the horse since then, and feel like I'm falling behind further every day...  
  
Any chance of at least finding out the differences in the rules between SuperFocus and Final Version?

My recommendation would be to use SuperFocus until the Final Version is released.
