It’s been a long time since I last mentioned this system - about a year I think - and I never did get to tell you what it actually consisted of. I can’t remember what it was that distracted me.

However it’s still going strong and is still in my opinion the fastest and best of the long list systems. I’ve restarted it today and so far the page results are as follows (page number followed by number of tasks undone, 31 tasks to the page):

1 - 3 (including writing this post)

2-  14

3 - 18

4 - 19

5 - 29

6 - 14 (out of 14)

Still a couple of hours left today!

Please note that the system does not use pages. I am quoting them purely for convenience of tracking how I’m doing.

Unfortunately this crashed and burned as I realised very quickly that I had been getting even better results from the “10 Tasks” system which I’ve been using over the last few weeks.

Oh well, that answers one question.

Always good to hear from you, Mark. Glad the system is working well and looking forward to hearing more about it.

Looking forward (as I was a year ago) to hear about how to do this system.

Thanks Mark, is there an article summarising the 10 Tasks system? (I had a quick look and couldn't find one.) Is it an expanded version of the old 5 task system?

I haven't tried it myself. But the Office Management Queen has just got me a nice big Moleskine. It would just be RUDE not to give it a go...

Does the "10 Tasks" system go like this?  
  
First make a list:  
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
6  
7  
8  
9  
10  
  
Next I'll split it into fives (to save time. Split into tens when doing normally)  
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
---  
6  
7  
8  
9  
10  
---  
  
Cycle through first list and do what stands out  
-  
2  
-  
4  
5  
---  
6  
7  
8  
9  
10  
---  
1  
3  
  
Then cycle through the next list doing what stands out  
  
-  
2  
-  
4  
5  
---  
6  
7  
-  
-  
10  
---  
1  
3  
8  
9  
  
Now you cycle through the last section doing what stands out.  
[A question that just occured to me: Is the last section an open list like in AF4 or would you have to close it too after it reaches ten tasks (five in my example). Say I do Task #1 and re-enter it. Now the last section has filled up. Should I close it off or leave it as an open list?]  
Then you go back to the beginning, cross out the old sections, and redraw new sections. Repeat the scanning process.

Mark:  
  
As an old Forster fan I wouldn‘t mind to be informed about a second best system, too.   
  
Maybe it has some features, that would be especially useful for someone. Or it could it inspire some of the coinventors on this site?

@Mark: As you did post the RealAutofocus instructions directly after your test results one year ago, I supposed that this was the method you used back then. If that's not the case, I'd also be very interested to hear what this HVHSLR method consists of

All:  
  
I'll post the instructions for both systems over the next few days.

Well, yesterday was my first day and it worked very well indeed. No idea why.

Much as I am looking forward to seeing the new system, I have started re-reading Secrets of Productive People (a short chapter a day on way into work), which is helping to flesh out my sense that what most needs looking at is my choice of focus, and attention to system failures. The input is much appreciated!

Mark, this must be your fastest crash and burns of any system tried?

Hi Mark: I have been experimenting with Fast FVP. How do you take breaks? Any tips on preventing burnout?

**Author:** Will

Asim,  
  
I put breaks in as tasks. Works fine.

Asim Jalis:  
  
<< How do you take breaks? Any tips on preventing burnout? >>  
  
Will's suggestion of putting breaks in as tasks is a sensible one.  
  
Another is to work to a timetable, e.g. work for 40 mins, take 10 mins break, work for 40 mins, take 20 mins break.  
  
Have a definite lunch break and stop working for the day at a definite time. This not only prevents burn-out but concentrates your work.  
  
When taking a break you can do anything you like as long as it isn't work.

Mark,  
  
One of the many tips that have helped me was your advice to those who are unable to get through their daily workload: finish earlier.  
  
Counter intuitive, logical and most importantly, it works!

Hi Will, as someone else in that category, it would be great to hear more about that - how does it work for you? (Do you never resort to doing any email catchup in the evening?)

---

**Author:** Will
**Date:** 2018-06-22

I find when I know I can stay late to sort out email, I tend to be more relaxed during the day and be less rigorous in deciding not to do things. Having said which, my levels of discipline are not yet consistent.

Is this still coming?

Hi Mark, I had been waiting to see your latest "10 Tasks System", wondering if this would be the final system that best meets the various criteria for a high functioning task management system; but now I am re-reading Secrets of Productive People and I am wondering if it is more a matter of using the kinds of questioning and idea generation approaches you suggest to assess how a system is working and adjusting if necessary (to improve things like thoroughness, drawing power, management of workload, speed, low resistance etc). ie not necessarily expecting one final algorithm that trumps the rest, but more a matter of drawing on the approaches you have suggested in designing a system that best suits ones situation and characteristics.   
Would be great to hear your thoughts on this (sorry if you have written about this and I've missed it)   
Hope you are well.

Yes, that would certainly be a good thing to be doing.  
  
I think it's actually impossible to produce a system which will suit everyone equally. Not that that is going to stop me trying!

Did this system ever get published? I can't find it.

Nope. Read the update in this very post.
