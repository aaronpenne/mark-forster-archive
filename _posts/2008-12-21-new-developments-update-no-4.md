A final word on the [six items](http://www.markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/12/20/new-developments-update-no-3.html) that were left over from Friday. Three of the items were completed today, and three were rejected by the system. The rejection of items is an essential part of the new method and is one of the ways of keeping oneâ€™s focus - it makes the need to carry out an audit *a la DIT* unnecessary.So the breakdown of the 66 new tasks taken on on Friday is:Completed Friday: 36Completed Saturday: 24Completed Sunday: 3Rejected: 3

Hi Mark,
This sounds so very good! I am very intrigued by the rejection method you alluded to and can't wait to see this system!
Best regards,

David:
I'm intrigued by it too, and seeing where it will take me over a period of a few weeks is one of the reasons why I am not revealing all now.
