The reaction to the new look for my website has been unenthusiastic to say the least. Apart from a couple of encouraging comments the reaction is that it is difficult to read and the colour scheme is not suitable for the contents.

So why haven't I gone back to the previous colours?

Because both the traffic on the website and the advertising revenue have shot up since the change. And since I can't see any other reason why they should, it's just possible that the new colours have something to do with it.

It's also just possible that it's a pure coincidence, of course. But in order to be sure I'll delay the decision whether to change back for a while yet.

I can't say I have a particular view on the colour scheme and layout.   
  
What I'm wondering is if the increase in traffic is due to the fact that you haven't updated it quite as regularly these last few days. I suspect there may be a number of people like me who like to get the latest daily instalment and if it isn't there, try again later - that would up the hits!  
  
Perhaps you should update it once a day at a regular time for a while and see if the number of hits decreases, and then switch back to a randomly timed update and see what happens!  
  
If the theory works out, it must say something about the effect of other people's randomness on our lives!

I like the new colour scheme, more soothing. Layout is a bit different but there is nothing wrong with change.   
Cheers

I check periodically each day for something new, so several hits per day are from me. However, if I follow the good advice in Do It Tomorrow (which arrived on Tuesday), I should limit my playtime on the internet more rigorously.   
  
I like the new color scheme. I've shared your diet approach with my partner (he weighs twice what I do). The free programs are a plus, too.  
  
THANKS!!! Please keep blogging.

I think the layout is an improvement.  
I think the font is a little faint either make it larger, bold or shift to something sharper like Arial. I only got back on line recently so the "old" layout was new to me. It looked sharp but I did not like the way the screen would go black for a period before it settled whenever I logged on.   
  
  
Maybe people are just adjusting to it and those who use it a lot are in mourning of the old style. Give it a couple of weeks and then make a judgment. The site has certainly improved since a year ago.

I happen to like the new look. So at least one vote for it. Looks really good at 1900x1200.

I agree with those who are not enthusiastic with the new layout. It's really difficult to read and the color reminds me of an old fainted tapestry.  
I think it's a pity because I really enjoy the contents of this blog.

Probably a total coincidence, but I happened to drop your name (and a link to your website) on a popular time management forum at around the time you changed your look. Not claiming for a moment that there's a connection, but the couple of entries that followed mine hinted that it might have generated some interest.   
FYI it was the "43Folders" Google Group.

Love the content (and your latest book), but frankly the new layout reminds me of the curtains and doilies in my (now deceased) great-aunt's parlor. i.e., a bit stuffy and old-fashioned.
