I’ve just started with Beeminder.com, which is a great website for giving yourself the maximum motivation to achieve a goal, whether it’s weight loss, exercise, blogging, book writing or reading, or anything else you can think of.

What I particularly like about it is that it gives you some very sophisticated ways of keeping on track, including some very nice coloured charts with lots of different bits of information.

I’ve started two challenges for myself today. The first is to work myself up to being able to walk 24 miles in a day (I could do 16 before Christmas but have regressed since then).

Here’s the graph that goes with that:

Basically I have to keep myself within the yellow brick road, but there’s a lot more to it than that.

The second challenge is to lose some weight, and here is the image for that (I’ve removed the incriminating evidence for this one!)

Note that in this sort of goal you get a period of grace at the beginning in which you aim to keep your weight flat.

I’ll post these images again in a few days time, so you can see how I’m getting on and how Beeminder deals with my results.

Ok, I'll bite! :) After reading the guitar post[1] from your other article, I'm now tracking 2 of my old goal nemesis… (curious to see where this takes me)

Thanks for the beeminder link. As I was reading about it I found a link to 750words.com  
I signed up for the latter immediately. What a great idea!

Wow, thanks so much, everyone! We're ecstatic about all the new sign-ups from Get Everything Done readers. Exactly the kind of people we want beeminding! We know there are lots of confusing things about Beeminder still, so please ask us lots of questions!

You're welcome, Daniel.  
  
I've got one suggestion. Tagtimer seems a really good application to work with Beeminder, but the instructions on how to install it are written in Geek and I can't understand a single word. Maybe you and the author(s) could get together to make it user friendly and integrated with Beeminder.
