Today is a critical day for the testing of my new Final Version system. What I am hoping is that it will complete the process of bringing down the number of tasks on my list to match the amount of time I have available to work on them. This is one of the most crucial parts of the system.

Of course it’s not only got to reduce the list. It’s also got to ensure that that tasks that are left on the list are the right ones. Tomorrow I am hoping I will be able to see whether this is what has happened. My hope and expectation is that once this initial stage is over I will be in the sunlit uplands of time management, where the right thing always gets done effortlessly at the right time. We shall see!

Mark,  
  
how can you tell that the number of tasks on your list matches the amount of time you have available to work on them? Do you estimate the time it will take to do the tasks? Do you account for necessary breaks?

"O nce this initial stage is over I will be in the sunlit uplands of time management, where the right thing always gets done effortlessly"  
  
I wish to know if today turns out easy, or else how mentally demanding it was.

Mark: I'm curious. In "Dreams" you talk about needing to become the future you that inhanbits the future reality. Are you aware of how you changed as a person to inhabit the sunny uplands? What does future Mark have to say?
