\*Do It Tomorrow\* now has no less than twenty reviews on [Amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=15A6MEDSE3SGM0V5NTW1&) - all 5 star. I’ve no idea whether this is a record, but it seems pretty darned good to me. If I came across a book on Amazon with that proportion of positive reviews, I think I’d buy it whatever the subject was!
