Do It Tomorrow now has no less than twenty reviews on Amazon.co.uk - all 5 star. I’ve no idea whether this is a record, but it seems pretty darned good to me. If I came across a book on Amazon with that proportion of positive reviews, I think I’d buy it whatever the subject was!Latest reviews:Consistently useful by HelenZen and the Art of a Clear Inbox by Daniel OtterburnThe last time management book you will need to buy by UmdolofiaMark Forster’s book can change your life by Nicholas BellBuy Do It Tomorrow
