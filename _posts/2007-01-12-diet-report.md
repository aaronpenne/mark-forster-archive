Since the British unit of dieting is the stone (14 lbs), it is important to celebrate the significant markers on the way. So today, since I have been on the diet for 7 weeks, I have officially lost half a stone (7 lbs). In fact I was a pound under target this morning, so I have actually lost 8 lbs. This means that I can remove one of the two rules currently in force. So today all my diet consists of is that I am not allowed second helpings. Easy peasy!Full details of the diet I am following can be found here.

Excellent progress, congrats, especially over the festive period. I like the idea of the rule based regime. Haven't decided whether I am following those rules or the 'NoS' or some other variety, but I am tracking my progress against less agressive target than yours. However my primary objective this month is follow the advice of doing an activity/task every day. So far 100% sucess and bizarely I am waking up earlier to do these exercises every morning.

Congrats, Mark, on losing a half stone! Despite my initial scepticism of this dieting method, I'm going to give it a go based on your success. However, because my eating habits are apparently somewhat different than yours, I have created my own set of rules. I'll let you know in a few weeks how I get on... Meanwhile, congratulations and enjoy the sticky pudding!

Dear MonkeyhangerCongratulations on getting the activities done.I'm not sure though what you mean by a less aggressive target than mine. Losing 1lb a week is generally considerable to be a sensibly slow rate of losing weight which gives the body time to adjust. To lose weight any slower than that wouldn't really have any advantages and would take a discouragingly long time if a significant amount had to be lost.

Dear KateI'm not really going to class my diet as a success until I have reached my final target and managed to keep there. However in the meantime the results so far are very encouraging. Good luck with your efforts!
