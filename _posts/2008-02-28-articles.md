I’m introducing a new category “Articles” which is intended for visitors to the site who don’t want to have to wade through a mass of small blog entries, but would like to be able to access major postings easily.It would be too much of an effort to make it retrospective, but I’ve added the category to the two most recent articles so you can see how it works.You can access it by going to Latest Articles in the Navigation section of the sidebar.**Update** on Thursday, February 28, 2008 at 12:22 by
