Thanks to a suggestion from reader Heffer I’m introducing a new donations button. If you like this website why don’t you try the button out right now?… it’s quite painless.

And you can buy me more than one coffee if you want to keep me writing!

Thanks for the reminder, Seraphim.  
  
But shouldn't this button be on the home page?
