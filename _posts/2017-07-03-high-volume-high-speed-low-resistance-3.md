Page count at the end of day 2:

1-15 - 0

16 - 22

17 - 28

18 - 24 (out of 28)

Total: 74

Thatâ€™s 95 tasks worked on today, including every one of the 61 tasks remaining from yesterday.

The list has now been further consolidated down to three pages by the system, which is the smallest number of pages that this number of tasks can fit on.

Ooh, you tease! I'm super excited to try this one :) Hope it continues to work well throughout your testing.

The "consolidated" bit has me intrigued. I've been using Fast Final Version? (scan the long list, dot what stands out, immediately work on it) and when I run out of pages on my notebook I consolidate it down:  
  
-Get new notebook  
-Choose only one item from each page of old notebook  
-Transfer those items to new notebook  
-Shred/burn/destroy old notebook  
  
It's weirdly freeing and fun, plus it pares things down to the important in an easy way. I wonder if you're doing something similar.

@Jesse: I don't think so. I suppose Marks new mehod has some similarities to my method, which I described here: <http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/1/high-volume-high-speed-low-resistance.html#comment21756160>   
  
The footprint of his method on consolidating tasks is something I experience too. The "main train" of tasks leaves only single tasks behind, which can't be actioned right now. A longer group of tasks is only uncoupled when I jump to an urgent task in the middle of the list, but this block is taken care of during the next pass. Consolidation acquired! :-)

No, no resemblance. I think I said it doesn't involve any preselection.
