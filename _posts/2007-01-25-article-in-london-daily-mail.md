There’s an article on “Beat Your Time Wasters” in today’s *Daily Mail* (p. 62), which includes some quotes (and misquotes!) from me. It includes a section about [Susanne Agerbak](http://www.searchmate.co.uk/index.asp?getpage=true&sid=53&ssid=193), who changed her life dramatically as a result of reading [Do It Tomorrow](/do-it-tomorrow/).> “I make a list of what I have to do every day, and I never add to it. It means I get everything done, and I can do it in any order so I don’t spend time prioritising […] I now have time to do more hiking and rock climbing, to learn Danish and take an Open University psychology degree.”Unfortunately there doesn’t appear to be an on-line version of the article on the *Daily Mail* website so I can’t give a link.
