With his permission I’m reposting a recent forum post by Wooba

—————————————————————————

This is how I have been doing things for a few weeks now:I don’t use a task list of any kind. I am as No List as you can get.I  have a list of projects. It is short and covers all areas of my life  including entertainment. I also have a list of life and work goals that I  update as needed.Every time I finish a task, I ask myself what  is the best thing to be doing now, and I do that until I have had enough  or it is finished. I try to go through my whole day like that.I  have been operating inbox empty techniques for years and try to always  be ahead of the curve. This colours my answers to the question of what  is best to do now. Inboxes aren’t just email, post, voicemail and stuff  like that, they are shows in your Netflix queue, piles of books to read,  dishwashers to empty, kitchens and bathrooms to clean. I clean as I go,  tidy while waiting for the kettle to boil, and use triggers to initiate  small actions.If some new urgent task turns up, I deal with it immediately or at the next task change.If  I am interrupted, I stop doing what I am doing and deal with the  interruption. That might be by giving it time, or by dealing with it  quickly so I can get back to what is the best thing to be doing now.I use checklists for repetitive projects that I don’t do often enough to have made them routine, such as taxes and accounts.I  (now) use dynamic lists for more complex projects where the next action  isn’t obvious. This list is destroyed at the end of the day or more  frequently if appropriate.I don’t have very complex projects that involve lots of people and resources, so I rarely need to plan.I  wouldn’t say it gets as much done as, say, AF1 or FVP, or especially  the random method did for me, but it gets the right things done, which  those other systems didn’t. I am not busy, because all those small tasks  that are written on catch-all lists just don’t crop up, because they  either never needed to be done in the first place, or only needed to be  done at the moment they were written down, or were just busy-work to  make my list look longer and me look busier and thus more important.  Now, I have time to breathe, to think, to rest, the urgent is under  control and the important stuff is progressed. And I have the capacity  to deal with emergencies with less stress.OK, some of it doesn’t  always work, but on the whole my life in general and work-life in  particular are running smoother than I have ever known.Thanks Mark. I couldn’t have got here without you.

No-List has been the most instantly, consistently helpful of all the wonderful methods I've learned here.   
  
No-List has this special effect of reminding me of the obvious fact that I can only do one thing at a time. And, if I truly accept that and intentionally pick the next thing (work, fun, hard, easy, important, frivolous), and then the next, and the next, I lose the resentment about what I'm doing and not doing.   
  
It seems to work particularly well when I maintain a current but separate Project or Long List, but don't consult them when picking My Next Thing for the No-List.   
  
New stuff goes on the separate list(s), safe but not in my face. I'm constantly amazed that my brain generates my No-List in a way that actually hits all the important stuff, and manages to include breaks and fun stuff too.   
  
A key part for me is that my only rule is that I can't do anything unless I write it down first. Send email, bathroom break, get lunch, whatever. It creates this lovely intention pattern throughout the day. Pause, consider, decide, do, stop and repeat.   
  
Suddenly I'm not fighting myself. That's remarkable.

Thanks for sharing Scott! I'm trying No-List right now and wanted to ask you about your point here:  
  
"It seems to work particularly well when I maintain a current but separate Project or Long List, but don't consult them when picking My Next Thing for the No-List."  
  
What do you think is the reason this works best? And, if you don't consult your Project or Long List when using No-List, when do you consult them?
