Just to say that I’m likely to be unable to connect with the internet for a week or so due to continuing problems with my ISP. This will affect the signing on of new members for the Forum and the approval of comments on the Blog. It will not effect the discussions by existing members of the Forum.

I may be able to access the internet from time to time by using other people’s connections but your patience is asked for.
