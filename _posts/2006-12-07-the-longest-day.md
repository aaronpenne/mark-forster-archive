Establishing a new structure for my day has brought back into my consciousness something I had forgotten. Yesterday was the first day of switching my computer on at 9 am and switching it off at 6 pm. At the end of the day I looked back and thought how long the day seemed. I have got so used to days passing like a flash that this came as quite a surprise. It shouldn't have, because I am always teaching other people that you get more done by limiting your working day. Yet, having let it lapse a bit in my own life, I was surprised again by justÂ how much difference it does make.
