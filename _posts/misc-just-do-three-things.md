A correspondent has drawn my attention to an article on the New Music Strategies blog entitled Just Do Three Things

It’s a very sensible article aimed at musicians particularly. But of course it applies to anyone who has trouble organising themselves and doesn’t have the desire to embark on a full-scale time management system. Often little tips like this can make a real difference in someone’s life.
