Comments are still coming in for the best answer to the question “Does using SuperFocus increase your brain power?” See the previous post.

Write a better comment than the worst of the five showing and your comment will take its place. I’m not going to say which I think that is!

Write a better comment than any other and your comment will be featured as a guest post on the blog. You can judge for yourself which is the best answer so far.

Make your comment on the original post - you won’t be able to on this one.

And don’t let the fact that you have already commented put you off having another go!
