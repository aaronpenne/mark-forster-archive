I’m pleased to see that [\*Do It Tomorrow\*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=18AD0V6642ACT8V56XDR&) has advanced to 230th in the overall Amazon UK sales ranks, and is 16th in their \*\*Self Help\*\* category, and 3rd in their \*\*Time Management\*\* category. The two books leading it for \*\*Time Management\*\* are Ken Blanchard’s \*One Minute Manager\* (is that really a time management book?) and David Allen’s \*Getting Things Done.\* I don’t wish to knock David Allen’s book in the least because it’s the only time management book I recommend other than my own, but I don’t think I could have got going again with my business anything like as quickly with his system as with mine.
7th in the \*\*Time Management\*\* category is my own \*[Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play](http://astore.amazon.co.uk/markforstthet-21).\* So I’m feeling quite well represented!

I agree with your comments about David Allen's book; prior to reading "Do It Tomorrow" it was by far the best time management book I had ever read, it all makes perfect sense and seems doable... and yet I never actually managed to implement any of his techniques\*! As you say, it is the simplicity of your system that is the real winner - if I were organised enough to successfully implement DA's techniques I probably wouldn't need a book on time management. Perhaps it is better recommended as further reading once one has fully got to grips with DIT.  
  
\*(I think the \_big\_ blocker was the initial requirement to find several days up front to "clear the decks".)

Hi again  
re GTD......too complicated....much time wasted \*tending\* the system itself.....I'd rather have a simple DIT system that invests my thoughts and attention on the work itself! LOL! LOL! LOL!  
Before the accident, a planner and index cards was all I needed because my brain kept it all in order except the cueing of the planner and index cards...Your system provided me with both the plan and the rule in the WILL DO list system...........If it helps me so much with my damning limitations, I won't even DARE to imagine how much it could help me bring my aspirations forward as a normal functioning person! AAAAKKKKK!!!!! I'd rule the world! LOL!

Ah yes, I do google myself quite often, and as you will see as well as being a time management "guru" I play Rugby Football for Warrington, play golf for England, and in my spare time am directing the next James Bond movie!  
  
DIT rocks!

Looks like an interesting book that is appropriate to my needs. I do need a book about time management. I find that with less workload I still can't find the time to finish before deadline.

Hawaii:  
  
It's quite common for people to find that when their workload drops so does their motivation. It particularly applies to people who are "deadline chasers" - who need the pressure to keep them going.  
  
Two ways of helping you to finish your Will Do list every day are:  
  
1) Give yourself an earlier finishing time, and make sure you have arranged to do something with someone else so you can't extend it!  
  
2) Use the simple points system described in the book - 1 point if you finish your list, minus 1 point if you don't, and keep trying to beat your highest score. It's surprisingly effective, especially if you keep a chart of your progress where you can see it.

I can only echo Mark's advice here. I have most certainly been "deadline chaser" seldom able to get anything done before a deadline. Only army service and Mark's book have been able to change my habits.  
  
I have been doing the points system for the last few months. How awful it is to not being able to give yourself the plus point for the day and what a satisfactory feeling it is to mark the point after completing day's list. Such a simple exercise but very effective.  
  
This week I started giving myself set finishing times to finish my work. Based on three days' experience this is also an excellent way to get focused. If there is too much time available your mind starts wandering. For me it is important to keep myself going once I have got into the working mode in the morning. If there is time to have a choice between doing a task and "doing something else", you are inclined to choose the latter. The momentum is lost and it is hard to get going again, unless you really have to.  
  
It is incredible how you can lie to yourself day after day that "I will do this later" and do something more comfortable. Do not allow yourself that freedom.
