I finished my Will Do list today at about 12.30 p.m., just in time for lunch. Everything has been pretty effortless so far, which is encouraging.The most important thing I did today was the item “Think about the future of my business”. That actually only took me about ten minutes, but generated a whole stream of other “Think abouts”, including:Think about:how to blog regularlynew subjects for seminarscollecting subjects for future articlessubjects for another bookincreasing sales of existing booksusing audio/video/teleclass formatstouringpublicityjoint projectsincreasing website circulationmonetarising my websiteI’ve scheduled these forward over the next two weeks in my Task Diary, and added at the end the all-important “Think about the future of my business again”.The great thing about the Do It Tomorrow system is that it enables one to keep the momentum going.Buy Do It Tomorrow

Hi Mark
Just being curious.....do you have a set time for opening up the office mentality? Also, do you use Noon as your target closing time? I can't deduce much on a two day data log! LOL!
It may seem a bit ridiculous, but reading about your endeavors seems to help me be more enthusiastic about my own......hmmmmmm......I wonder why....maybe it's that body double phenonenum that people talk about...the phantom incentive of feeling like a part of a greater whole effort...It's alway illuminating to bounce off experiences and knowledge to create new thoughts and experiences.....who knows why...but this really exciting to watch the Master journeying through his own innovation!I await the next day's data/progress with abated breath! LOL!I might be over-stretching my welcome but, I feel compelled to ask......Do you aim for a *what's better?* entry daily, or weekly, or what other interval?vickie

Both these last two days I started work about 8.30 a.m. but had breakfast after that. My aim at the moment is to start first thing and get it all done as quickly as possible. Once I've got the whole Will Do list done I can do what I like - even answer blog comments!I think though that over the next few days and weeks the amount on the list will increase considerably as I start to move forward, so I'll soon be looking back to the days when I could finish at noon with nostalgia.If you're using the "what's better?" method (which I'm not at the moment), it should ideally be done daily. But as always, there's no law about any of this. It's what you find works best for you that counts.

Out of interest, what is your normal expected output from a thinking task? I find myself thinking about things and jotting down notes, but not turning the ideas into actions.

Hi DavidThe essential thing with thinking tasks is to realise that the whole point of them is to generate tasks in the Task Diary.
