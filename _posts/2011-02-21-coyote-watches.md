BryanR of our discussion forum has put an interesting article on his blog Coyote Watches about his experiences with AutoFocus and SuperFocus and how they have helped him with the effects of Post Concussive Syndrome.> What the system allows you to do is keep a list of activities that you roll through every day.  Most to-do lists are open ended, you just keep adding to the end of the list and you tend to forget about the beginning.  His system is a closed list that loops around on itself which causes older tasks to become relevant again.  This is perfect for my memory issues.

Mark and Alan, thanks so much for the kind words and the nod towards my article! I greatly appreciate it and I hope it helps to get more people interested in the system. It needs to be shared!~Bryan~
