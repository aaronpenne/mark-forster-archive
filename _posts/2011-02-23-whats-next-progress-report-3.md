The next edition of my Newsletter is now ready, and scheduled to go out automatically on March 1st. Iâ€™ve decided to make it a monthly from now on so that there is a proper deadline involved. This was an easy task for SuperFocus. I put it initially in column 1, and it was then transferred to Column 2 as an unfinished task. It only needed two sessions for completion.

For the April 1 newsletter, did you reenter the task in your list column 1? If not, where is it?

I think that once Superfocus is "production ready", it is good to start advertising it. I mean not like real advertisement, but spreading the word among those, who may be interested. I believe that there are ideas worth spreading and Superfocus is one of them. So, anyone has ideas how and where it could be accomplished?

At the moment it's in my head. If I felt I needed a reminder I would use an Outlook reminder (or equivalent).

Simple : lets setup a spambot that would SPAM any and every blog entry (or amazon book review) in the interwebz about "time management" "personal productivity" "procrastination" and "GTD". The word would be spread for sure. Or, more ethical, let's do it manually. Let's say I'm taking care of the francophone web pages. How do i handle this project in SF so Im done before 2015 but still have time to play?

I posted a link to it from <http://reddit.com/r/GetMotivated> which isn't a very busy sub-reddit. Someone commented that they were confused so I created a google document where I tried to explain it with examples by copying Mark's article and adding to it. I honestly don't think I did a very good job, so I'm hesitant to mention it here. I can unpublished it from google docs if you want me to, Mark.  
  
I also told a co-worker who is interested in time management systems about it and he was going to try it out. I haven't checked back with him yet to see how it's going.

I just worked on them for as long as I felt like doing so. I can't remember exactly how long they were because I didn't time them. Probably about an hour in total.
