Today I finished my work by 3.45 p.m. which was just as well as I have an engagement at 4.30 which will take out the rest of the day. So far I have succeeded in sorting out quite a number of outstanding matters and, as you will have seen, getting the blog going again. I have a far greater sense of being in control, but there are still many things which need sorting out - especially the state of my office! That will be my next Current Initiative once I have cleared my backlog of paper, which should only take a day or two more.Buy Do It Tomorrow

Hey Mark,Are you going to discuss in further detail your experiments into a different more intuitive time management system and what you have learned? Actually my opinion is that your DIT is about as simple as it gets though...Andy

Hi Mark
Today I finished my work by 3.45 p.m. which was just as well as I have an engagement at 4.30 ......
As Lou Armstrong said (paraphrased)...
Don't just tell me what to do.....Give me a deadline!When my house is messy, I invite guests! When I don't want to do something, I promise it at a specific time to someone I respect......It's so exciting to read your journey and notice the parallels with my own work habits and attitudes....
This is truly inspiring stuff! Thank you for allowing us to be voyeurs! LOL!

Hi, AndyNow why would you want to know about methods that don't work? The nearest I got to success was using the technique I described in yesterday's post "Structure v. No Structure", but even that needed to be used as part of a structure, not on its own.
