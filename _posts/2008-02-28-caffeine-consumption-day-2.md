I’ve just finished the day after midnight drinking my nineteenth cup of tea - truly a revolting experience!

The trouble is I don’t really know where to go from here. I certainly don’t feel at this precise moment that I ever want to see another cup of tea again, but will I still feel like that in the morning? And even if I do, how long will it last?

I think what I will do tomorrow is drink as much tea as I want naturally and record how many cups I drink. We’ll see whether the last two days’ exercise has had a beneficial effect or not.

I'm following your caffeine consumption "study" with a great degree of interest.   
  
I'm concerned that you are breaking a tea habit, but not a caffeine habit ... thereby leaving yourself open to starting a coffee habit? Good luck and let us know how it goes.

Thanks, Mike.  
  
Actually I very rarely drink coffee - usually only on formal occasions. So I don't think it is likely to be a problem.  
  
Total tea consumption yesterday 12 cups.  
  
Today (as of 3.45 p.m.) 5 cups.
