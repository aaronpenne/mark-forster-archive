Interestingly the list took on a different distribution today with no further pages finished and the total active pages rising to six. Neverthless the total number of tasks worked on during the day was 96, a similar number to the two previous days, and the number of tasks left on the list actually fell by seven.

1-15 - 0

16 - 5

17 - 5

18 - 15

19 - 11

20 - 8

21 - 23 (out of 24)

Total: 67
