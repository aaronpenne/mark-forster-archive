One of the disadvantages of the otherwise excellent Evernote note-taking software is that it does not have an alarm function. However you can work around this because it does produce an individual hyperlink for each of its notes. This link can then be dragged or copied to a variety of programs which do have alarms. The most obvious of these is Microsoft Outlook. I've already described here and here some of the ways in which links can be used in Outlook Tasks. This is another.

If you are an Evernote user, try dragging a note heading into the Task icon in the Outlook left-hand margin. What happens?

You will see that a Task box opens up with the link to the Evernote note shown as an icon. Click on the icon and you will be taken directly to the note (it will be the last note shown on the Evernote page).

You can now use the alarm function on the task box to bring the note link up whenever you wish.

One Note 2007 does something similar. If you flag a line as a task (<ctrl> +<shift> + 1) it creates a task for today with a link to the note in it's body.  
  
Of course you would usually use <ctrl>+<shift>+2 to get a task for tomorrow!   
  
The task status is linked to the flag in OneNote, so checking off either as complete will complete the other.

you say ( quoted ) "you can work around this because it does produce an individual hyperlink for each of its notes. This link can then be dragged or copied to a variety of programs which do have alarms"  
I would use one of theses programs, but I am not using Outlook, - then what do you suggest instead of it?  
  
Thanks  
  
Best regards  
  
I tried for example something named "Kerby alarm", but you can't enter the whole path of Evernote files in the selection box, so it is useless

Dear Dan  
  
I suggest you try googling "task reminder software" or "task reminder freeware". I'm sure you'll get lots of possible solutions.  
  
Let us know if you find one that you can recommend.  
  
Mark

task reminder freeware:  
( if you do not want to use outlook, or not have outlook installed : please see "alarm for EN" in the Evernote forum, date 07/03/2007  
( simple use of autokey utility / and standalone version too from a autokey user )  
  
regards

In my opinion, the absence of a simple, integrated way to create alert/reminders in Evernote severely impedes the usefulness of the product. Microsoft OneNote, which is free on the iPhone, affords a much more robust solution with an array of tools for ensuring that notes that require action are not overlooked. It's not much use to explain to your boss that you had the note to take action, but didn't do it because you had no way to create an alarm for the item in the application where it resides.

I love OneNote, use it all the time. It has a great connection with Outlook, and many people love to use it for alarms. Myself, I don't use alarms at all; never felt a need as I just remember the rare appointments on my short list of things I must do today.  
  
The iPhone version is not a good version of OneNote.
