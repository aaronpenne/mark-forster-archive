- Write This Blog PostOne thing I’d like to draw attention to is the effectiveness of the system in hammering home projects which require cumulative repetion over a long period. There are several examples of this in the list. I’ll mention only two. “Harry Potter à l’école des sorciers” (the first volume of the Harry Potter series in French) had four sessions and there were three sessions of push ups. Keeping projects like these - reading, language training and fitness training - going day after day with multiple sessions per day really produces results and FVP is excellent at this.By the way, the idea with the Harry Potter book is that once I’ve finished it in French, I’ll then use the French edition as a crib for the Spanish edition, then the Spanish edition as a crib for the Italian edition, then the Italian edition for the German edition, and the German edition for… who knows which language? Maybe Dutch, maybe Modern Greek. Russian might be too much of a stretch.

Mark:
That's awesome that you're reading the Bible in the original languages! I studied koine greek & hebrew at seminary but still struggle to read fluently.
Maybe put a task item of "refresh languages" on my FVP list!

Not so awesome. I read with an English crib for both languages. But I taught myself a lot just by doing that.

Thanks for that - very interesting. I liked the description of Judith as a James Bond girl!

I did not realize you were a polyglot, Mark. That is great.
I have tried out your new FVP system for a couple of days and so far it has been effective. The psychological ease of implementing the system and getting things done is astounding. Thank you for your work in this.

"Polyglot" would be two strong a word I think. The only language I have a good reading and speaking ability in is French. I could probably get by in Spanish or German if I had to, but that is all. The others are really just dabbling (though I take dabbling quite seriously).

I found it interesting that studying time management or productivity is not listed as a task. I realize it may be due to a particular day or something I missed. Unless Mark is making the point, maybe the most important suggestion of all: give any system a suitable trial run without constantly modifying the rules.

The whole list is a study in time management and productivity.

Interesting.
Regarding projects like reading, do you find that approaching a task like reading the NT in Greek, it is better to define a task by length/material as opposed to time? For example, "read one chapter" as opposed to "read for 30 minutes."
Forgive the frivolous question as I am still an apprentice compared to others on this forum.

Normally I don't bother to define the length of a task like this when using FVP. I just do it for as long as I feel like doing it.
However in the specific case of the OT and NT I do it chapter by chapter for the simple reason that I am actually using audio files and they are each one chapter long.

That is terrific. My favourite parts of your books, Mark, were invariably the detailings of real time/real world examples, similar to above - (even more so in the examples where your day went "off track" and you managed to turn it around again).
Feel free to add more like this, please - suitably anonymised if necessary. I find it very inspiring! I'd be interested to see the results from your trialling of the "exciting" question.

Don't expect any exciting answers!
For some examples of what I consider to be exciting see:

Ha! Sometimes there is Excitement even in the prosaic - particularly when one is trialling a new Mark Forster TM system!
