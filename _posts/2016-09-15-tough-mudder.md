With great regret I’ve been forced to withdraw from the Tough Mudder Half which I was due to take part in this coming Saturday.

The reason is that the cancer which I suffered from in 2014 has now returned, and I’m in the middle of scans and consultations to determine what to do next. To say that this is a trying time would be an understatement.

Nevertheless I did all the training for the Mudder up until about a week ago, so I hope that those of you who have been generous enough to sponsor me and my team won’t feel that you have been swindled!

The amount raised so far by my team on the Eventbrite site is £1,222.23, to which another £60 given directly can be added, making a total of £1,282.23 (approx $1,649).

It’s not too late to donate if you would still like to support my team in this event even though sadly they will be without me.

Mark, you're one of the most resilient people around, my friend, so this little bug better be prepared for what you've got cookin'. Of all people, you will adapt, improvise, and overcome. And I think I speak for many of us when I say you are not only our coach but our friend, and as your friends we are all here for you, we love you, and we're cheering and praying for you for a quick return to pure health. Blessings are being sent your way, Mark. We've got your back. Take whatever time and steps you need to relax and let your body rest up and recover.

Wishing you strength, peace and ultimately health. I just found your site by way of your book DIT, and then purchased immediately SPP you more recently published.   
  
Without getting too far into it and sounding a little too evangelical about it, I wanted to say the books have helped me in more than just time management. You can call it life management. Things have clicked in my head for other areas of my life and it's all helped in a way that I did not expect, and at a time when I did not think I was receptive to anything helping.   
  
Little and often, questioning, looking at the structure/system of things in the face of disorder, have been quite elegant solutions to some personal stuff and for that I thank you.   
  
Normally, I don't post. Ever. Anywhere. However, what you're doing through your work and what you're doing vis a vis this blog is truly commendable and very much appreciated.

Hi Mark  
My prayers are with you. I was also diagnosed with cancer in 2014. I'm still actively battling it. My only advice would be to be flexible with your daily strategies and hopes. When I hurt from being cut up, burned or green at the gills from the treatments, I change my perspective to make today as bearable as possible. I keep my perspective in check. Instead of worrying about dying, I try to focus on being grateful for being alive today and hopefully tomorrow. I love using comedy to distract me when I can't eat. I also love being outdoors to comfort me. Gazing at nature, feeling the breeze or gazing at the stars gives me perspective. We're all a part of this ultimate grandeur. I hope you find your own methods of easement and hope. Mostly, I depend on realizing my relative gratitude in it all. Sometimes it's the obscure tender mercies and small gratitudes that can make the day go by a little bit better. If possible, tay on the lookout for these things. I'm sure your family and friends are a great comfort and help.  
  
My prayers are with you. Stay strong. We're still alive and in the game. We haven't been benched!

p.s.  
As you are are a productivity guru, I'm a bit loathe to offer this last bit of advice to you.   
  
When I've been rendered helpless for an extended period of time, I dial back my conscientiousness to my responsibilities. I only make sure that my insurance premiums and taxes are paid and current.   
  
When I finally have some respite, I simply bag (ignore) the little stuff and embrace the day with gusto. I squeeze as much joy as I can out of the day. Maybe in the evening, I'll attend to some of the other bills and other life maintenance responsibilities. If I have enough good days in a row, then I can backtrack and tie up loose ends.   
  
  
Reflecting back on the good day that I made gives me renewed hope that there will be more to come. My WILL DO LIST on these days is to do whatever is possible to keep my hopes and gratitudes in good supply! LOL!  
  
Here's an idea...  
If your energy levels are OK enough and they haven't yet started your active treatment plan, maybe you can still do the Tough Mudder. You said that you're current with your fitness training. Maybe you can still put it to good use.I try not to allow fear to make my plans. I try to strategize my aims more on what I actually CAN do despite what my thoughts are. It can be a real boost to your sense of personal agency.   
  
I did a 5K with a terrible, embarrassing time.... but I felt powerful by staying with it. I really NEEDED that experience to feel strong.   
  
Whatever you decide, my prayers are with you. Stay strong in spirit whenever it's possible. I truly think that it helps overall.

I'm sorry to hear this as well. Prayers for recovery and comfort that only the Lord can give.  
  
@Learning I'm also sorry to hear about your battle with cancer. I'm not surprised that you have such a positive attitude. I believe that attitude is so powerful in recovery. Prayers for you, too.

So sorry to hear your news. Thinking of you. It is only in the moment that life is truly lived - how my self needs to learn that (when it is racing ahead, worrying about the future, getting caught up in busyness). I have been an avid reader of your books for years and think what you have been doing with your books and your website is absolutely fantastic. You have been amazingly accessible, always trying to help others.- may the favour be truly returned and that you will be able to overcome this again - you CAN do this.

Zane:  
  
I seem to be having endless consultations, scans and tests, but nothing has actually happened yet treatment-wise. I saw a haematologist yesterday and am probably going to see an oncologist today. Your prayers are and will be very much appreciated.
