As a result of my testing of the Final Version over the last four days, I’ve felt it necessary to make some changes. The main problem was that I wasn’t satisfied that unfinished tasks were being processed sufficiently often.

To combat this, I’ve slowed the overall rate of progress through the system so that more time can be spent on finishing.

I’ve also re-introduced “dismissal” into the system, which brings back its filtering capability, which was in danger of getting lost.

Dismissal is back in the system? Very good!

Perry suggests here that having chronically unfinished tasks on the to do list is useful: <http://chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959>

I'm glad there's a lot of progress in your work. But how does the "dismissal" function works? Does it work like "cancel?"

Halley:  
  
Dismissal is a feature of most of my systems since the first version of AutoFocus. It is a way of taking tasks off the active list without removing them entirely from the system. They can be reviewed, revised and re-instated or eventually removed entirely.

It would probably be helpful if We knew the details of this "final version" so We can work together to highlight any pitfalls and/or concerns. Software Engineers have a saying, "Many eyes make all bugs shallow," which means the more People examine a problem, the less likely it is to remain unresolved.

Sorry to be such a pain in wherever, but it's been one week since you reinstated dismissal into your system. How are you doing sofar?

Brian,  
  
I wonder whether the extra effort in explaining the system and going into the feedback would be justified? My gut feel is that trials on a cross section of the community would be a good thing if properly co-ordinated and assessed. However, I'm not sure that many other systems get this level of rigour, and I'm also not sure whether Mark has the necessary expertise on tap. It may well be that his editor does double duty as "voice of the customer".  
  
Mark,  
  
If you ARE looking to pull together a group for early feedback, I'd be happy to drop £20 for a prepublication draft. Which rather implies that I don't think there'll be much wrong with it. I have to say that a neutral bystander probably wouldn't recommend me: I am chronically unreliable and struggle to keep anywhere near my list. Then again, if you're looking for an extreme challenge.  
  
Then again again, are you taking pre-orders?

Will,  
  
Another point to consider, though, is whether any of the 'untweaked' variants of the 'final version' work for Others. For example, version #46 may be adequate, if not perfect, for Person A while Person B may find version #53 exactly what They need and Person C see exactly the process They want (or are willing to accept) at version #104.

I for one think Mark's approach is exactly right. Public experimentation was useful for developing and validating ideas. But it also create tremendous fragmentation, and doesn't help to create a coherent community around one concept.   
  
In order to have the coherence, Mark needs to pull back, define everything, refine everything, document everything, and then present the Answer. Once the answer is presented, everyone will naturally adapt it every direction, but there will be a common reference point to rally around.

Too early to say.

I agree with Alan!

Publishing the info on this site could be seen as counter to his goal of publishing a book. On one site there is great benefit for him if he discretely sent the system, via email, to his more loyal fans, and get feedback. But there is the danger of someone blabbing and then going viral with the info.   
  
The best of both worlds might be to create a rough draft, and only send it to people willing to (electronically) sign a non-disclosure agreement for a reasonable time period. Loyal fans eventually could blog and tweet and really get the sales hopping later on.  
  
Yes, tidbits on the secrets can be frustrating, But I appreciate the need for a level of secrecy. Face it, people can spend years developing something, and have it posted for free online in minutes.
