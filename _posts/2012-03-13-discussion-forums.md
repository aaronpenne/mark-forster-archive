I have introduced a new discussion forum FV Forum solely for discussing issues related to the Final Version time management system. I’ve closed the Comments on the last two blog posts in order to direct comments to the Forum.

The existing forum has been renamed General Forum and is for issues related to time management in general and previous time management systems of mine.

For an experimental period both forums are accessed by Captcha - I hope this will be sufficient to keep spam to an acceptable level (i.e. none at all). If this doesn’t prove to be the case then I will have to re-introduce posting by registered members only.

I’m also for an experimental period removing moderation from blog comments and relying on Captcha only.
