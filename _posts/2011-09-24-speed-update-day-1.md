Today I managed to do 61 tasks off my new list, with 39 remaining in the list.

The number of days work left on the list is therefore 0.64.

The oldest unactioned task on the list dates from today (which is hardly surprising as the list was only started today).

One of the tasks I accomplished today was a walk of over 15 miles, which took me away from 11.50 a.m. to 7 p.m. as it required some travelling to get to the start.

You beat me by about 40, and also by 13 miles.

To get this clear: you stared with 100 tasks (61+39), you completed 61 of them and you are left with 39 for the next day. That's a lot! I could never do that many tasks in a day, because on average a task takes 30 minutes. Mark, yours seem to be only 5 minutes or less. What kind of work do you do?

No, I didn't start with 100 tasks. I actually started with 12, this being a new list which I was starting from scratch. The others were added during the day as I thought of them or as they came up. Quite a few were re-entries.  
  
You can't compare the number of tasks I did with the number of tasks you are likely to do because my list includes both work and personal things and I use the list for everything - from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. I also use the "little and often" technique, so I might break a 30 minute task into three ten-minute segments, each of which would count as a task in my statistics. On the other hand the 7 hours 10 minutes I spent on "Go for a Walk" only counted as one task.  
  
The really significant figures are not the total number of tasks but:  
  
1) The number of days work left on the list.  
  
2) The oldest unactioned task on the list.

"I might break a 30 minute task into three ten-minute segments, each of which would count as a task in my statistics."  
This changes my understanding of your count entirely.

Alan.. What?! You knew this all along. You've been on this site for a long time.

I know how Mark operates, and I do similarly. But when counting tasks, I don't count the same task multiple times.
