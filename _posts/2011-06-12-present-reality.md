As promised earlier today here are my initial and current Present Realities:

27 May

I am fed up with endless lists of things to do, which never seem to be anything but a treadmill and still leave me disorganised. I long for the sort of peace I have described in my Future Reality. I feel frustrated and that I don’t have much time left to get things right. I am though encouraged by re-reading “Dreams” and a good start to doing what I feel like today. Although my health is on the whole good, I am overweight and unfit. I keep intending to go for long walks but keep failing to get going. There are people I would really like to get to know better and make enduring friendships with, but I never seem to be able to make the necessary effort.

12 June

I’m keeping on top of email, paper and the other daily commitments in my life, though my office still leaves a lot to be desired. I’m still keeping on developing the principles of Dreams which means I haven’t really got moving on the Manual yet. On the fitness side, every day I’m taking a daily long walk and doing yoga, and have just started the 100 push-ups challenge. I’m working hard with my French both aural and reading. The …. blog is up and running and for the first time I am editing news videos to go on it. I’m feeling now that things are really beginning to move and it’s exciting.

I’ve remarked before and it’s still true that “Dreams” has so far proved just as reliable as any other method in getting stuff done. In addition it’s proved invaluable for sorting out the things I really want (you should have seen some of my alternative Future Realities!) and for getting moving on them.

The shift in you "present reality" looks very exciting.   
  
 "I am fed up with endless lists of things to do, which never seem to be anything but a treadmill and still leave me disorganised."  
  
I don't really resonate with this quote in that I'm not tired of lists, but I now understand them to be insufficient. I'm very glad you picked up Dreams because the discussion is inspiring. I'm not following your process, but I am thinking more about long term goals and wanting to achieve them. As a result I spent about 6 hours Saturday working on a very difficult Phase of a project and made progress which has eluded me for years.   
  
And I failed to make any progress in house work. This was in fact a necessary sacrifice , difficult to accept, empowered by future thinking. And not one I shall need to make too often.   
  
I still believe in the Autofocus systems but I'm taking control. They will be bent to serve my goals, and that includes both content and process.
