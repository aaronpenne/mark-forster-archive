1. **Never say no**   
   Be careful not to say no to other people in case you cause offense. And of course never say no to any of your own impulses - that would be to limit yourself.
2. **Don’t be systematic**  
   Establishing good systems would take a lot of time which you don’t have - mainly because of the huge amount of time you have to use sorting out the mess caused by your lack of system.
3. **Keep starting things you don’t finish**  
   Having loads of unfinished projects is a sign that you are a person with huge potential - even if it hasn’t yet translated itself into any form of achievement.
4. **Build up huge backlogs**  
   Backlogs are a sign that you are a really busy person, and therefore a really worthwhile person.
5. **Take more work on than you can possibly do**  
   Too much work provides the perfect excuse for not actually achieving that much.
6. **Keep chopping and changing**  
   If you stick to projects until they come to fruition you will miss out on loads of opportunities (which you will also fail to stick to).
7. **Don’t sort things out**  
   When something goes wrong you have two possible courses of action: 1) give up, or 2) work round it. The third course of action - sort it out - would obviously be far too impractical.
8. **Don’t identify any long-term goals**  
   It’s much more fulfilling to live in the present.
9. **Avoid doing anything that takes you out of your comfort zone**  
   Life is for enjoying, so why spend your time struggling to make things happen?
10. **Do first things last**  
    Always have plenty of easy trivial tasks to give you a reason for not tackling the more difficult things which really matter.

11. Seek out interesting diversions/distractions like watching TV or surfing the internet or posting inane comments to blog posts.

Bang on the money Mark (and Paul B!). I'm hoping this isn't too inane...

Sadly, I am 9 out of 10 with this list.  
  
But this list is spot on.

Which is the one that you don't suffer from?

Hi Mark,  
  
Because I seldom say No, I get pushed to do #9:  
  
9. Avoid doing anything that takes you out of your comfort zone

Mr Unproductive:  
  
That's an interesting thought. One I hadn't consciously put together before.
