I’ve now taken action on 253 tasks over four days, making a daily average of 63.25 tasks.

There are 63 unactioned tasks on my list, which means that the number   of days’ work left in the system is 1.00 days - the slight increase each  day continues.

The oldest tasks (twenty-five of them) on the list date from yesterday.

Today was a very good day for me. Some major breakthroughs. Not as much time as I wished to delve into a current big project, but maybe next time.   
  
22 different things moved forward. 3 left-over from yesterday. Oodles of older tasks, but the total number went down a bit. I believe I've reached the equilibrium point at 30 days, and you're just starting.

Did you dismiss anything ever since ?

I do sometimes delete old stuff when my rules suggest that action.

Mark, I have to wonder if your list includes tasks concerning the creation, publication, and distribution of your book about this new system. ;)

Alan : your numbers look nice, but the question was actually directed to Mark. Thank you for sharing anyway :)

Laurent;  
  
Nothing was dismissed in these figures, but I have now re-introduced dismissal into my trail system.

Mark,  
When you write about doing 60+tasks in one day, what is the actual nature of the tasks, perhaps with some examples please. I don't know why I am asking because my task list may be completely different, but I am just trying to get some sense of perspective.  
Thanks

Hi Mark - I've tried several times to capture the metrics on how many tasks I am processing per day -- but it's just too hard. Tasks are not crossed out in my OneNote system - they are deleted or moved forward (drag & drop).  
  
If I come up with any other ideas for capture the metrics in the same way that you are doing for your new system - I will let you know.  
  
Thanks!

Tasks can consist of anything at any level, from "Re-arrange paperclips" to "Bring about world peace".  
  
Here is the actual list of things I did on September 19th. The figures in brackets after some items indicates where I did them more than once. The list includes a lot of trivial tasks (which are however essential for life maintenance and background reading) but also progress on an important report, a lot of language learning, an eight mile walk, ongoing clearance of email, paper, voicemail and blog comments, a strategy session, and one blog post.

Suggest you take screen clips of a random sample of your pages and then compare how the pages look at the end of the day. If you do this for a few days running you should get a pretty good picture of what's happening.  
  
I'm sure OneNote has a screen clipper built in, but if not just copy the whole screen by using PrtScr.

Forget news about "New System.". What's happening in Season 2 of "Downton Abbey"?!?!  
  
Waiting until January here in the US.

It's very exciting. At the moment Doctor Who has landed in his Tardis at the Abbey and his assistant Amy Pond is pretending to be Lady Mary in order to assist Hercule Poirot in finding out whether it was really the butler who did it.  
  
Can't tell you anymore now... it looks as if the Daleks are about to attack!

Thanks for the answer about what is on your list Mark. Looks like your blog may take a turn into movie reviews.

Today's movie: Bergman's "Wild Strawberries". Although not one of his best known works, this is one of Bergman's deepest and most moving movies. It can be counted among the most successful portrayals of old age in movie history, thanks partly to a wonderful performance by Victor Sjöström, the father of Swedish cinema. 5/5

"It's very exciting. At the moment Doctor Who has landed in his Tardis at the Abbey and his assistant Amy Pond is pretending to be Lady Mary in order to assist Hercule Poirot in finding out whether it was really the butler who did it."  
  
A side effect of rapid task switching among entertainment options? ;-)
