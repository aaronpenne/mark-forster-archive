The rules for SuperFocus can be found by clicking here.

Brief Summary

SuperFocus is basically AF1 with a second column added for unfinished and urgent tasks.

Advantages

As in AF4-3T the emphasis is on finishing tasks. However it is more flexible and doesn’t slow down to the same extent when a number of longer tasks are being processed at the same time. It also allows urgent tasks to be done quickly.

Disadvantages

It can become rather directionless with a lack of proper balance between the two columns on the page. These disadvantage will be overcome by the forthcoming v. 3.

Conclusion

At the moment SuperFocus suffers from some disadvantages, but when the new v. 3 is released in the near future it will be the perfect time management system.

So, i take it that you are not going to improve AR4R, as you stated you would do after the revision of SuperFocus. I guess this has answered all of your questions, so that a revision of AF4R is unnecessary, correct?

Wow Mark, that is a bold statement! Looking forward to seeing it!

Matt:  
  
I can't remember where I said that I would improve AF4R - no doubt you'll tell me!  
  
As far as I'm concerned the new revision of the SuperFocus instructions achieves everything I want in a time management system, so I don't plan to do any more developing after they've been published.

If the claim proves true or mostly so, I think it will be a good thing for the community. The present diversity is, I think, more than we need  
  
I also find the wait healthy. It's good for everyone to more fully understand - in practise- the strengths and weaknesses of the present systems.

You will appreciate that I've had a very definite goal in mind in developing all these systems, which is to develop a system which gives the perfect balance between easy and difficult tasks, and urgent and non-urgent tasks.

I certainly do appreciate that. No complaints, just eager to see the community converge.

But of course I will! :-)

"Thanks for chasing me, Neumatist. Instead of doing what I said I would do, I've been (among other things) trying to refine the rules for both SuperFocus and AF4R. The SuperFocus revision looks the most promising at the moment..."

(and several similar statements)  
  
I've been perplexed: was this an example of Mark's gently ironic humour, like the Russian wife?  
  
But now I've got it: the system involves achieving goals by publicly staking one's cred on stunning claims.  
  
So I don't think I'll be brave enough for it.

I can't see how saying that I've been trying to refine the rules for AF4R amounts to stating that I'm going to improve AF4R.   
  
But anyway I have no plans to develop anything more.

No, it really will be the perfect time management system (for me anyway).

Mark:  
  
I think the statement I quoted is slightly ambiguous. I guess I read more into it. Here's how I read it:  
  
- I'm working on refining SuperFocus and AF4R.  
- The revision of SuperFocus is showing the most promise at the moment , so (implied) I'm working on that one now and will report on it first.  
- (implied) I will then revise AF4R  
  
But, I can see how your statement doesn't violate what you are saying now.  
  
I willing to bet that I'm not the only one who read it the way I read it.  
  
I'm looking forward to your revision.  
  
I'm especially curious to see how you address what for me are two major problems:  
1) The brain-nag of "what's on another page I need to be doing that I may know about right now?"  
2) Task re-writing. My hand cramps easily, so I'm sensitive to rewriting. I don't want to rewrite unless I've actually done work. If I'm only moving tasks from one place to another, then I start having problems.

@Matt,  
  
Have you considered using a fountain pen? Writing with a fountain pen necessitates using much less pressure than a ballpoint pen or pencil, since increased pressure will either ruin the tip of the pen, or scratch the paper, or both. Your penmanship will improve, too.  
  
There are some problems with using fountain pens: (1) you will need quality paper, (2) you cannot write on some surfaces such as plastic Post-It tags, (3) fountain pens are more expensive and take more time to take care of.  
  
However, I find the easing of the wrist cramps I had after using fountain pens has been worth it ^\_\_\_^  
  
God bless!

"I don't want to rewrite unless I've actually done work."  
??   
  
I thought for all Mark's systems you only needed to rewrite if you do something.

Yes, that puzzled me too.

Why would it puzzle you? If you have already written down a task on another page, but you are working on a SF page, and you happen to remember it because it seems urgent enough to work on today, you'll rewrite it in column 2 so that you don't forget it while working on the current page.   
  
Also, when you get down to one task in column 2, aren't the rules to rewrite it on the next page?  
  
No puzzlement necessary.

I see what you mean. Rule 1b.   
  
"Also, when you get down to one task in column 2, aren't the rules to rewrite it on the next page?" this part I don't think is there. It sounds vaguely like 3T but not really.

Alan,  
  
Yeah, rule 1b. But, the other one is a rule as well. It's buried somewhere in some of the comments under some blog or discussion. It's not 3T – though it's 3T-like.

I just reread this. I meant to say:  
  
1) The brain-nag of "what's on another page I need to be doing that I may \*\*NOT\*\* know about right now?"  
  
I'm sorry if that mislead anyone.

Keep the list short and go through it often. Then there won't be any urgent things you're not aware of. Even if there is one, you'll get back to it soon enough.

Matt:  
  
I see what you mean.   
  
In the new version the rules about how you use column 2 are different and the particular rule you are referring to doesn't still exist.  
  
I'm finding that the list remains quite short (currently my list has 3.5 pages) so I am pretty clear about what's on it. If you have any doubts, then I would recommend reading through the entire list at the start of each day.
