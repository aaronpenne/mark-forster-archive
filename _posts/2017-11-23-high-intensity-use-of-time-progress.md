I seem to have succeeded in sorting out the bugs in my proposed new method. So I hope to reveal it soon. I think I’ll post the method before, rather than after, writing my short ebook on the subject so I can incorporate reactions to the method in the text.

This ebook will definitely be free of charge once it sees the light of day.

I'm looking forward to this one. Though if I were you I'd stick on Kindle for a quid.

That's great, Mark - well done on getting past the problem. Looking forward to hearing more about it. I'm sure you'll have many enthusiastic test pilots.

This may not be what you are looking for as regards “reactions” to the new system, but I would be willing to use the the new method for a set amount of time, whether a week or two months. I also record stats, tasks completed, task added, tasks undone, etc. for each day. You have been very generous with sharing your systems, many of them which I have used over the years and have asked for little to nothing in return. With so many great folks following this website and your systems, I imagine it would be easy for a number of us to be test subjects who recorded impressions, statistics, etc. This would be addition to those who happen upon the system or just try it out. Anyone just an idea from someone who would like to give back for such generosity (besides buying Mark’s books, which I have done.)

If it is able to live up to the hype, don't rush it. Take your time ensuring your fix holds up in the long run.

My plea is to stress the importance of attitude and mentality around using catch-all lists and trust in the smartness of unconscious, intuitive processing

My worry in all this is that 'unconscious, intuitive processing' can lead to an abrogation of 'conscious, rational processing', where the latter is the better approach.

To intuit or not to intuit?  
  
Do you trust your hunches when confronted by an important decision?  
Do you feel in your body if a decision is right or wrong?  
Do you put a lot of faith in your initial feelings about people and situations?  
Do you put more emphasis on feelings than data when you make a decision?  
Do you rely on your gut feelings when dealing with people?  
Does your intuition often turn out to have been right all along?

It’s really very interesting, the seesawing roles of ‘conscious’ and ‘unconscious’ processing in different activities, and it doesn’t matter how much you ascribe the distinction to mere metaphor, because it’s undoubtedly useful.  
  
In her wondrous 1934 book, Becoming A Writer, Dorothea Brande may have been the first to articulate the dual nature of the writer, and advocate fast (‘unconscious’) production followed later by careful, conscious, deliberate self-editing.  
  
The copywriter Eugene M Schwartz hada strict work regimen. First, he’d examine the product till he knew it to death (usually a book), producing volumes of notes. Then he’d read those notes and launch himself into writing the ad, working in discrete half-hour stints punctuated by a kitchen timer. Schwartz considered that all his ideas came during aha moments in the breaks – but that they were predicated on the massive amount of conscious work he’d done beforehand.  
  
Bruce Lee studied every martial art under the sun and moon, including fencing. When it came to battle – sparring, really – all rules melted into action.  
  
So sometimes you prepare consciously and then let it fly. Other times you create freely and put it in order later.  
  
I’ve no idea what this to do with to-do lists.

Martin: Interesting points. AF lists are not to-do lists of course.
