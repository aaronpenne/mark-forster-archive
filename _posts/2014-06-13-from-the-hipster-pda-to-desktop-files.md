There’s an interesting article on various vehicles for to do lists on Danny Schreiber’s [Zapier blog](https://zapier.com/blog/to-do-app-alternatives/), which mentions a couple of my systems.
I hope he’s corrected the spelling of my name before you all write in and correct him!

Oh no! Just fixed. Sorry about that, Mark. I actually work with a "Foster", so I'm blaming my fingers for typing too fast on that one. That's my only excuse. :)
