I’ll have run off the yellow-brick road with my walking goal by the end of today. That means that I’ll have to take out a contract with Beeminder to continue the goal.

I could easily have stayed on track because to do so would only have required me to walk 5 miles or so, which I would have no problem doing. But I have two excuses (they don’t qualify as reasons):

1) The temperature has been below freezing with snow on the ground. This has encouraged me to sit at home in my nice centrally-heated house - at least it did until the heating broke down on Thurday night!

2) I want to see what happens when there is a contract, i.e. I pledge real money in order to stop myself from going off-track. Is this a good motivating method which might have other applications?

Hey Mark,  
  
About making FV even better, I just came across a free online course from a Professor at the University of Michigan about using Models to make optimized decisions. I thought you might be interested in going through it, as it might affect positively the Final Version!  
  
The previews look majestic! You can check them out here <http://www.coursera.org/modelthinking/lecture/preview>  
  
And join here <http://www.modelthinker-class.org/> ;-)

It looks interesting but how long does the course go on for? I don't want the FV put off even longer!

The course starts by the end of this month, and lasts for 2 to 3 weeks.  
  
You just get online videos of the lectures, divided into around 10 minutes each, the Introductiory lecture and the first theme lecture in the course are already in the preview link I provided, really interesting stuff!

I'm not going to be able to follow it now, I'm afraid. Maybe when I'm back from Australia.
