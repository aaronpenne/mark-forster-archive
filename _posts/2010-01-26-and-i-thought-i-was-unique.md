Well I believe I am unique. :-) The site says "1 or fewer" in the USA have my name. I strongly suspect that number is 0.

I think you're right. The site returns a confident "There is 1 person called Barack Obama in the United States".   
  
But there are 434 George Bushes!

Here's another interesting fact that I learned from this site:  
  
99.75 percent of people with the first name David are male.

Since there are 3,653,748 people with the first name David, that would mean that 9,134 of them are female!

Hi Mark  
LOL! No wonder you didn't like calculus courses! I was shocked that they stated that only 5 people share my birth name and only 11 share my legal alias! The ironly is that I thought I was chosing a more unique name! lol!

A good deal more than 11 are called Learning, but none of those have Go as a last name ;-)

I have one match, and I strongly suspect that he's my cousin of the same name.
