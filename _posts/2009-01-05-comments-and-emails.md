The comments and emails have been coming in thick and fast. I’ve been answering every one that seemed to need an answer, but it’s just possible that I’ve missed some. So if your query or comment appears to have been ignored, please draw my attention to it or re-post it.

I am late to the party - I just signed up for your newsletter today. Any chance I can still join the beta testing for Autofocus?  
  
I just got a new position within my company and want to make the best first impression I possibley can.  
  
Regards,

Questions;  
  
In the email prior the system release there was an instruction to also buy a smaller notebook. It wasn't mentioned in the instructions. Was it deleted or is this the home notebook?  
  
Also, as the day progresses for an office worker do you add things like return phone calls to the last page of the list individually or treat them as a separate list with the add being return phone calls?  
  
I need to sit down tonight and create the first list.  
  
Thanks  
  
Gerry

What the email said was:  
  
"A notebook with ruled lines (at least 20 lines to the page). I use an A4 book with 34 lines (Letter size is the nearest American equivalent) for office work and a smaller A5 book with 31 lines when travelling. If you want to use the system for more than one location (Workplace, Home, etc.) then I recommend a book for each location."  
  
Re phone calls: whichever works best for you.

Hi Mark, you may recall from a previous post that I had only recently discovered DIT and was finding that helpful, I have a busy job (reactive environment), home, community commitments and want to start up a new business. I started back at work after 2 weeks off yesterday and worked through emails most of the day jotting tasks down as I went for those requiring more than a very quick response and filed items away confident in the knowledge that I had a single record of actions, so empty In-Box! Today I am working my way through the list 32 items long, which would normally fill me with dread but is actually feeling enjoyable, will report back on what I achieve.  
  
Will tonight produce my Home list in sep book as recommended, I really like the separation aspect that provides between work and personal.

Good stuff, Titch!  
  
I'll be interested in how it develops for you.

Cleared 14 items plus a few "extras" which crept in through calls and email. Cleared all the incoming email, feel calm and in control - first time for a long time with Work. Definitely focused on what needed to be done, no missed deadlines, and what I did felt to be the right things. Looking forward to applying to Home now!

I started on the first day and had a full page list almost immediately (my large book is home and my small book is work) i now have only 14 items left on first page and have filled half of second which also has a few items crossed out. I keep adding clear email and thencrossing out, as with walk dogs which is a resistance item. My question is: how do we address what used to be current Initiative? On my first page are ;start assignment' and take x exam but these are long standing resistance items and i have not actioned anything on either of them? Thanks Katie
