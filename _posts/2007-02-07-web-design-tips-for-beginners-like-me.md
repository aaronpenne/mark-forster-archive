Here’s a couple of tips which you might find useful when you are trying to improve the look of your website:

Have you ever wanted to duplicate an effect on a website but didn’t know how to code it in html? You can find out the code for any page by using a facility on Internet Explorer. Simply go to the View menu and select Source. That will show you the complete code for the current page as a text file. A lot of people don’t know that menu item is there (I didn’t until recently myself) but it can save you hours.

If you ever want to match on-screen colours, there’s a very simple utility called Color Cop which will tell you the code for any colour you see on screen. You can use it to magnify the colours so that you can identify the individual pixels. What’s more it’s free!

Hey the color code link you gave doesn't work.

The link is over eight years old so it's not surprising.

Someone at work showed that to me the other day, and I felt I had to share. :-)
