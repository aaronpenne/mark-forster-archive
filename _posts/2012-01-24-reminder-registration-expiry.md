This is just to remind you that the number of registrations for the Forum is limited to 250 and that number is currently filled.

This means that every time I get a request for a new registration I delete the existing account which has been unused for the longest time. The current longest one has been unused for 1 year 73 days.

So if you haven’t used your account for a while and want to make sure it doesn’t lapse, all you have to do is log-in to the account. You don’t have to make a post.

If the number of requests for accounts rises considerably so that the unused period before deletion gets unacceptably small, I shall have to shell out some extra cash and upgrade my account with Squarespace. Mind you, that would also allow on-site registration so that would be some compensation!
