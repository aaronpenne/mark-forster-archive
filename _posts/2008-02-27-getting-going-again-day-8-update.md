I finished today at about 4 p.m., though I carried forward a few items in the Task Diary to tomorrow to spread the load a bit. I’ve got all day tomorrow to get the Will Do list finished so that shouldn’t be a problem.One of the tasks I’ve set myself for tomorrow is to write an article on “Friction”, which is the difference between the beautiful smooth-running day that we plan to have and the reality of the chaotic day we actually have!
