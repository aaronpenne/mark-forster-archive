At the end of the day the stats are:

Page 1: 33 done, 0 remaining

Page 2: 33 done, 0 remaining

Page 3: 22 done, 11 remaining

Page 4: 13 done, 20 remaining

Page 5: 5 done, 28 remaining

Page 6: 4 done, 23 remaining

———————————————

Total: 110 done, 82 remaining

=================

That’s in a bit less than two days. It seems to be progressing satisfactorily. I’m particularly pleased that the number of tasks remaining seems to be static, and also that the 5-4-3-2-1 method has not once failed me.

I’ve been thinking up some other ways of using 5-4-3-2-1 which I want to try out. So I’m going to leave the Halving system for the time being and do some more experimenting.

Maybe try it with the root tasks of FV?

Glad to hear this, Mark.  
  
Combined it 54321, I think it solves me the problem I face with SS - where I always an easier task at the end tk avoid the ones, I should be really doing.  
  
Good stuff.  
  
Will give it a try this week.
