I’m currently laid up with a temperature and flu-type symptoms, so I’m operating a skeleton-service only on the website. What that means is that I’m currently keeping up with comments, but everything else like writing new blog entries and dealing with forum registration requests is on hold for the moment.

Most things are still on hold for the moment, but one thing I have caught up with is new subscriptions to the Discussion Forum.

If anyone has applied for membership but has not heard from me yet, please contact me again.

Mark, get plenty of rest...nap often! And very important with these kinds of virus infections....drink plenty of fluids! Plain old water is the best. Get well....we all are thinking of you.

Well, Mark, I hope we don't have to take the heading of your blog entry too literally, or that cold of yours is worse than we thought!  
  
At least you don't have too much in the way of backlogs nagging you, thanks to your wonderful SF system.  
  
Best wishes for a speedy recovery.

I'm sure you have a SuperFocus notebook at your bedside, with a Column Two entry: "Kill more germs." :) Best wishes!
