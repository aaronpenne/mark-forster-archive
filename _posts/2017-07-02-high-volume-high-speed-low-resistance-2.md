One more characteristic of the system, which I forgot to mention yesterday:

At the end of the second day of the trial the page count is as follows:

1-11 - 0

12 - 7

13- 17

14 - 24

15 - 13 (out of 13)

Total: 61

That means that 100 tasks were worked on today, including every one of the 56 tasks that were on the list at the beginning of the trial yesterday.

Notice too how the new system has consolidated the list left over from the previous system - which was spread out over 11 pages - down to only 4 pages.

By 6.20 p.m. today I’d cleared two out of the four pages left from yesterday and started two more. So the list still extends over only four pages.

I’ll be doing some further work this evening, though not a lot as we have friends over.

- It does not use any form of pre-selection

I like the concentrating effect.   
  
The sheer length of the grasscatcher list seems to dilute my energy with my focus. Yesterday, I restarted with half a dozen key tasks at the bottom of the list and then went back and scrubbed all the old tasks which were covered by the new ones.   
  
Seemed to help.

That was basically what this new system did yesterday - except that it did it by getting me to actually do the tasks, not just re-arrange them!
