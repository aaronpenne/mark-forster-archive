I built a new productivity system using weighted randomisation since the last time around (which was hampered by somewhat seismic life events). I have not as yet named the system, but I guess we should for the purposes of the challenge. Let us go with... Prioritised Shuffling. A lousy name, but it will tide us over for now.  
  
I have had a little go with it and made some tweaks, but I will try to use it in its current form for the duration of the challenge unless I can see that there is a clear bug causing it not to prioritise the right things at the right times.

LAPS.   
  
It’s a short-list system (not a long list, nor a no-list) with some planning elements in it. I may discuss more in the forum.

Randomizer Execute/Explore variant:  
  
This is based on Randomizer but with pages grouped for "execute"-type tasks (simple tasks, recurring tasks, things with deadlines) and "explore"-type tasks (reading, open-ended projects, ideas, and "execute"-type things that need to be unstuck).  
  
It's kind of fluid at the moment, and not much else to say yet, but I intend to stick with it for awhile and see where it goes.

Longtime reader and appreciator, first time poster and lenten challenger.  
  
I intend to do the challenge in emacs org-mode using the 3 tasks method fed by an autofocus 4 list as elucidated here:  
<http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/11/7/the-rules-by-which-i-ran-the-demo.html>  
  
So: AF4+3T.  
  
Wishing everyone a clarifying and productive challenge.

Hi Mark  
  
Could you alter my choice to Austin’s “Simple new system “  
  
Thank you.

**Author:** Jacqueline
**Date:** 2023-02-21

I'm going to choose Austin's Simple System as well (Thanks Calibre for introducing it to me!)  
I've been doing an Unstructured AF1 in a weekly page Hobonichi for several years now. Look forward to something new for a change.

I enjoy watching Mark's choice shift from day to day. :)   
  
For my own entry, I think I'm going to try a new approach I'm building around Eat the Frog. I think I like calling it the Frog and Chain system. I just started it, so I think I'll try to see if I can use it through Lent as a test of its "staying power".

I'm very excited about this Lenten Challenge - lovely to see the forum being lit up with new enthusiasm, and to see new contributors as well as the golden oldies.  
  
I'm going with (Seraphim's) Serial No List, possibly using 3T (3 Tasks system) to process it.  
  
For the first three weeks of the challenge I'll be in my normal environment with a lot of discretionary time, but for the second three weeks I'll be in a much more pressurised environment with less discretionary time. If I had six weeks in my normal environment I would have been more adventurous and happy to experiment with something different, such as AF4/3T, which I didn't try out first time round, but during the second three weeks I need a system with minimal overhead and very little compulsion to follow set processing algorithms. (This is not a criticism of any system - usually I love the gamification of following algorithms - but I know from my experience so far that in pressurised periods I don't have the bandwidth).  
  
Good luck to everyone.

At some point I guess I have to stop lurking and bite the bullet, so…  
  
Mark, please sign me up for 'Dreams', possibly with a side-order of SoPP/no-list…  
  
  
[Any hints from experienced Dreamers will be gratefully received.]

Random Halving?

My first real attempt at DIT.

I'm torn between Serial No-list or Gerry's old pdf of Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management (found during recent clean up of my macbook).   
  
I'll go with Gerry's PDF instructions. The instructions allow for a 'hot list' of tasks, which could be satisfied by No-list with a rough sketch of the day ahead.

<< Random Halving? >>  
  
I assume that's a question, rather than an entry. If I'm wrong, please let me know.  
  
It refers to <http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/8/24/a-new-random-method.html>  
  
I changed my entry to non-random Halving just before the clock struck midnight!

I am late to reporting in, but not to my Lentan system, which I began yesterday, 2/21.

Yes, a question.   
  
Thank you for the answer.

I was hoping to take part in the challenge (using DIT), but your website refused to accept comments from earlier. Trying once more in a private windows. At least the preview mode is working now.. Let's see if this one comes through.

**Author:** Ville
**Date:** 2023-02-22

The comment came through this time (with typos). But is it too late to take part?

Ville:  
 << But is it too late to take part? >>  
  
I've put your entry on the list. It's a personal challenge not a competition, so no umpires!

Oh.   
  
It's that time of year again.   
  
FWIW I'll be a relaxed FVP paper and pen (which means I won't be too concerned when I go off list) for the rest of Lent.  
  
Nice to see people are still engaged.  
  
Good luck, everyone!

Sorry, Mark, I'd missed this last week, but had already set DIT again as my Lent activity. And so far, so good ...

I wonder if I can still join.  
  
Been developing a system I thought of since December last year I call Elastic AF, and finalized it more or less on February but then I got sick and hospitalized. Now I'm out and raring to use this method, it's pretty dope IMHO.

I would be interested to hear details about this, if you don‘t mind.

@Laby  
  
Sorry for the late reply, I have been meaning to answer back. However, I get tired easily lately because of my condition, and combined with my inability to think of a way to make it work on paper and pen (it is a strictly electronic system for now, on Obsidian) I kept on delaying my post.  
  
With that I decided to just make a post of it in the General Forum titled "ElasticAF: a strictly electronic system" or some such in a day of two.

Thank you! I‘m looking forward to it.

Well, I'm out. I'm doing Time Surfing now.

**Author:** Mike Brown
**Date:** 2023-04-04

I'm tapping out as well. I have so many pages of different lists that I'm absolutely lost. I'm starting to lose track of things.  
  
Moving back to Remember the Milk for my online task tracking, while still using pen and paper to scratch out a rough hourly schedule and no-list for each day. I was using this hybrid method before the Lenten Challenge to stay on top of stuff flying at me, while having some direction for the day. I liked it a lot.  
  
Not sure what I'll do with all those pages. Perhaps they'll go into a notebook or perhaps I'll trash them and start fresh.

I am out. Just didn't sustain it more than a few days at a time.
