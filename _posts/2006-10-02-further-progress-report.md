The final step in getting this website fully functional has now occurred and it is operating happily under the www.markforster.squarespace.com address, complete with its prized Google 5/10 rating.The only problem seems to be that the new address has thrown all the Google ads off just as they were beginning to adjust to what this site is about.And what's happened to all my spam? I haven't had a single piece of spam since the re-hosting, even though I set the email host's spam filter to OFF. Knowing how inaccurate some spam filters are, I prefer to deal with my own spam through the medium of my highly trained copy of InBoxer. (I get no financial reward for that recommendation btw)**Memo to self: Must change that!
