Due to personal reasons, I am having to postpone the Q&A Session conference call for a week. The new date is April 23. The time remains 8 p.m. UK Time.I originally intended it to be a free session, but I wanted to limit the attendees to 20 so everyone on the call would have a chance to speak. Unfortunately past experience indicates that when a session is free of charge there is a tendency for people to book but not turn up. This prevents people who do want to attend from being able to. I’ve therefore decided to charge a nominal fee of £5 (approx US$8). This will have the additional advantage of testing my payment and booking procedures.Booking will open in a few days. I will announce it on the blog and in my newsletter.

£5 seems eminently reasonable. How will the audio conferencing be done? Will there be a toll-free (from the US) number to call? Or will you use something like Skype?
