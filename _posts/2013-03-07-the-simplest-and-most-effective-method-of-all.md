I’m using a very simple method myself at the moment, which is proving very effective for me. I’m describing it purely for interest as I do not recommend it for other people’s use.

It consists of the following steps:

- Write down three tasks

- Do the first two in order

- Add another two tasks (so there are three tasks again)

- Do the first two in order

- Repeat ad infinitum

The method can be used with all one’s usual lists, reminders, etc, but I myself have found it works best for me the less I consult them. This is because every time I do two tasks the method requires me to think carefully about what I should do next. This seems to result in a training effect on my mind enabling it to grasp the totality of what I have to do. This ability is inhibited by relying on lists and reminders.

As this method is intended for myself only and not recommended for other people, I have disabled discussion on this post.
