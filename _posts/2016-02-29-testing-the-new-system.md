I’ve arrived at what I hope is the working model of my new system. What can I tell you about it at this stage?

Mainly that it’s intended to be an improvement on 5T in ease of use, flexibility and lack of resistance.

I’m going to test it out for a full 7-day week, starting today (Monday). During this time I’m going to make no changes to it whatsoever.

There are certain things which I will specifically want to be able to achieve by using it.

Daily blog post

Daily maintenance of zero inbox for email, paper, Facebook, Evernote, etc

Visit the gym at least twice

Go for a minimum 3-mile walk on four out of the five days I don’t go to the gym (allowing one day’s rest)

Issue my newsletter

Write marketing plan for local association [first draft]

Write article for association’s magazine, plus photos

Daily book reading

Do the monthly tax claim for local charity

Sort the remaining two drawers in my office

Dispose of one year’s business vouchers, statements, etc, kept for six years according to Inland Revenue policy

Draft outline for new book and discuss it with my agent

And basically keep up to date with everything else

I’ll keep you posted!

I didn’t finish the testing because I got some better ideas for the system. Nevertheless I managed a good number of the items on the list. I’ve crossed out the ones I succeeded in doing.

This is not even teasing anymore, this is outright torture :)

Pre-flight checks complete, our test pilot taxis onto the runway, applies the brakes and opens the throttle.   
  
Good luck, Mark!

Just back from the gym on Day 1. Tomorrow's blog post in second draft. Comments answered. Email dealt with. First four pages of book read. Next stop: the monthly tax claim.

Will this system be available to the public for free or will we have to buy it?
