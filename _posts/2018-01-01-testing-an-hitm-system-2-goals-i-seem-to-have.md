Looking back this morning on my first day of testing yesterday, it occurred to me to ask the question:

“If I were a stranger looking at the list of what I actually did yesterday, what would I say my goals were?”

Now bearing in mind that yesterday was not only a Sunday but New Year’s Eve as well, here’s the list I came up with (in no particular order):

There are two huge omissions from that list: Exercise and Writing Blog Posts. But, hey, it was supposed to be a day off!

Now if I take this HITM thing seriously I should see my goals change and develop in ways which would be inaccessible otherwise.

Bliadhna Mhath Ùr! from Scotland.  
  
Looking forward to your hearing about your continued progress and tireless endeavours, Mark. I'm currently trialling HITM/Simple Scanning after about eight months of No-List FVP. The new system is more powerful than I anticipated.  
  
Your posts continue to inspire me, even many years on from reading your first book. Thank you, and very best wishes.
