I see that according to the website http://greatfirewallofchina.org/ my website is blocked in China. I canâ€™t imagine why that would be. If anyone in China can actually read this, perhaps you would let me know!

Good link. I am banned too. I thought it was for my subversive ideas, but maybe they don't like people to get organised. Seems they don't mind the population indulging in prOn though, I tried entering an adult site, which was not banned.

I am apparently banned as well, but I note that the website says that the sensational information may not be all that it seems. In fact, it may be meaningless, which is obviously a different kettle of fish.

Although the amazon.co.uk home page is not blocked, the page on which my book Do It Tomorrow appears is!  
  
Obviously highly subversive of something or other.

I'm reading this at my office in Shanghai. I can also view Wikipedia from here (though it has been blocked before).  
  
My experience is that the consumer access is much more heavily firewalled than the business access.

Sorry, that should read "that consumer access is more heavily firewalled than business access" -- omit the "the's".
