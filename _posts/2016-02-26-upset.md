Oh dear! The new development which I mentioned in Thursday’s post let me down badly yesterday - with the result that I’ve gone back to the fully no-list system I was working on before.

That’s the trouble with sharing progress along the way. I have little more idea than you do what the final system will look like - and anything I say about it at this stage will probably change.
