As of this moment, Do It Tomorrow is ranking 203rd in the Amazon UK overall sales ranks and is 1st in the Time Management category. It is also 9th in the Self Help category. This is quite an improvement over the last time I reported on its ratings.

I’m really pleased to see that the book’s sales are beginning to rise, as my own personal feeling - and more importantly that of the 20 people who have given it five star reviews - is that it is one of the very best books out there on time management.

If you haven’t bought a copy of Do It Tomorrow yet, then why not do so?

And if you already have bought a copy, then why not come on one of my seminars for people who have read the book and want to take it further?

Buy Do It Tomorrow

As of now, Do It Tomorrow has moved up to 125th place. Keep buying!  :-)

Its good to hear that Do it tomorrow is rising up the amazon.co.uk ranks, however I'm surprised that is on over 4 week availability on amazon.com  
  
I have used Do it tomorrow and get everything done extensively in the development of my organisation system so talk about them a lot on my blog, as the majority of my readership is from USA it is frustrating that they would struggle to purchae your books from amazon.com

It is frustrating - especially to the author!  
  
Sadly no American distributor has taken the book on.  
  
I usually advise people in the States to use one of the sellers under "More Buying Choices" and to go for one who actually has the book in stock in the States.
