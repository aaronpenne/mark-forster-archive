Cite Bite is a great little application which allows you to reference any text on any website.

If you click on this linkÂ  it will take you to a highlighted paragraph on the lifehack website (the same one I quoted in my last post). All I had to do to generate the URL was to highlight the text and press the Cite Bite button on my browser.

Full details here (and the highlighting is mine!) http://citebite.com/y6k0s2p3yuqu
