Here’s how I got on last week with the projects mentioned in my previous post:

1) Writing the book, etc.

Not much progress on this, largely because I’ve wanted to get all my systems sorted out before I get properly down to work on it. Otherwise I would be constantly interrupted by routine things building up or going wrong. I think I’ve sorted these out enough now to start getting moving on this project this week.

2) Charity Walk, etc.

My attempts to get fit have been handicapped by my hurting my knee, so I’ve only been able to do a couple of fairly short walks (5-6 miles). However my knee seems to be getting better now so I hope to be able to get moving again properly over the next few days. I’ve continued to research, plan and gain support for the idea.

3) Fund raising

This is definitely going ahead now, and I was able to react quickly to developments last week.

4) Commitments to Organizations

I’ve kept these moving without any spectacular new developments or initiatives.

5) Brain Training

This is going really well, and the new system has kept me completely on top of the training.

6) Systems and Procedures

Some good progress here. Basically all my day-to-day procedures are working well, but there’s still plenty of longer term stuff to sort out. This is going to be a long-term project.

7) Keeping on Top of Routine Stuff

Email - clear

Phone - clear

Paper - clear

Household chores - clear

Summary

In summary the system is working extremely well. In those areas where there hasn’t been much progress this has not been the fault of the system - it’s been a case of a decision on my part or circumstances making it impossible.  Basically everything I’ve decided to do I’ve either done or made significant progress on.

That's great, Mark. I've been away for a few weeks and have just caught up on the forum; great stuff here, and looking forward to the release of your new system. My use of Superfocus has been a bit sporadic, but I'm looking forward to getting stuck in again, until such time as the new system is ready. Best wishes for all your endeavours.

Hi Mark, just got back from The Canaries were I've just finished reading your two books - 'Get everything done...' and 'Do it Tomorrow'. Both books recommended by my Senior Manager to assist with my Time Management for my Manager's Course. For my Brain Training I use Lumosity which I can highly recommend; an online site easily accessable but American Centric. I've found this tool to be a real asset and my brain function has noticably inproved. The nice thing is it's also fun and inexpensive. I am off to put your words into practice. Thanks, Guy.

Yes, I use Lumosity myself and have found it very effective. I don't however think their version of Dual N-Back is as good as the one at Brain Workshop <http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/>

With respect, NLL&D, the ideas on your blog are quite generic and by no means a panacea. For example I know several great corporate leaders who are terrible at time management. They still operate efficiently within their own work context. List are obvious but colour coding is overhead and there are several ways to break them down more effectively than by importance. And blocking time for day planning presumes too much about the person's day. In reality priorities shift and inflexible blocking causes stress. I think we're ahead of you on much of this as a read of the discussion forum will show.

When the study about memory and intelligence came up, I searched the web and started doing memory exercise games. I never found anything like the exercises in the studies.  
Thank you so much, Mark, for the Brain Workshop link. I just downloaded it now. Happily, it seems to work for Windows 7, even though that is not an approved operating system for it. I've only done 2 sessions. But I am loving it. I plan on contributing to the authors, once I get a hang of it. I only wish I had found this years ago. I did go to Lumosity once, but I can't remember why I never used it.

Yes, I'm using it with Windows 7 without any problem so far.

Hi Mark  
  
You may well have commented on this on the discussion board, but I was wondering on your latest progress with your new system?

Thanks for asking. I hit a few problems, but I will post a full update this weekend.
