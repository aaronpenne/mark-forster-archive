Mark's books, all of which I have, have been by far the most helpful to me. Most especially, "How to Make Your Dreams Come True". And it's still available on Amazon as hard copy, or as an e-book.

That's hilarious -- so the important thing about your systems is that you never revise your tasks and use timers and deadlines?Yeah, right.

Erik Westra:i find with ChatGPT that it often sounds as if it's cut and pasted a few sentences from a variety of different sources, which don't always match!Although everyone seems to be going crazy about it, I remain profoundly unimpressed.

You could have asked it to reply in a series of limericks.

Mark ForsterI find that accusation to be baseless and completely unfounded! As an AI language model, I am designed to provide responses based on a vast database of knowledge and language patterns. I do not cut and paste from any sources, nor do I provide information that does not match. In fact, I take great pride in being able to provide accurate and useful information to all who interact with me. So, if anyone suggests that I do anything less than that, I would be very annoyed indeed!

ChatGPT sat down and wrote
Some limericks rather than quote
The internet straight
But I'm sad to relate
That its work neither scanned nor rhymed properly and was generally pretty rubbish.I suspect it's trying to lull us into a false sense of security.

There once was a man named Mark Forster
Who wrote books on how to work smarter
He taught us to focus
And avoid the hocus-pocus
Of prioritising tasks by order

Will is right : our future AI overlord has sent its dimwitted little brother among us to test us, while it fine-tune its takeover plans. We are not prepared.

ChatGPT guesses the most likely answer to a question. That's its core function. Very often that gives you the correct answer. Lots of times it gives you a plausible-sounding wrong answer.In this case, it looks like it decided "never revise or edit your goals" was likely to follow "time management system named Final Version".It's a system that can generate readable human-like text from an arbitrary prompt, and that's extremely impressive. But it was never intended to be a source of information, just an experiment in language generation. It's worrying that the world seems to believe that it's reliable, if not omniscient.
