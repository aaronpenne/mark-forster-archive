[\*![Product Details](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bZwvaiWPL.\_AA160\_.jpg)Secrets of Productive People\*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1473608856/ref=as\_li\_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1473608856&linkCode=as2&tag=markforstthet-21) is my latest book - and if you haven’t read it yet then you should!
The book has:
1 Introduction
5 Parts
8 five-star reviews on Amazon.co.uk.
50 secrets
150 strategies

You will find just about all my current time management teaching in it. But it’s about a lot more than time management. The emphasis is on productivity - and time management is dealt with as part of that wider context.

\*\*Aids to Productivity\*\*
\*\*Productivity in Action\*\*
\*\*——————————————————————-\*\*
\*\*BOOK DESCRIPTION\*\*
\*\*What are the 50 secrets of productive people that the rest of us should know?\*\*
Some books promise a lot but fall down because they are hard to use in your daily life. This book works by boiling down the essentials of productivity into short, quick lessons that you can apply instantly. Every one of the 50 secrets in this book contains 3 strategies you can put into practice right now. These are the real productivity tips you need to get ahead.
\*\*Ready to Learn the Secrets of Productive People?\*\*
Who are the most productive figures in the course of human history? Isaac Newton? Vincent van Gogh? Henry Ford? You will almost certainly find that the names you think of have made a real and measurable difference to the world, usually for the better. They will be people of great achievements and who have made the world gasp in amazement.
You probably cannot imagine yourself in your wildest dreams being productive in the way that they were productive. And you are probably right - you are never going to equal their achievements in their own fields.
\*\*But how about in your own field?\*\*
Can you apply the principles that they used, consciously or unconsciously, to your own work, your own lifetime passion, or even to your leisure time, so that you produce results that are every bit as amazing to you yourself, your colleagues, your customers, clients, friends and family, as their results were to the world at large?
\*\*Surprisingly, the answer is almost certainly ‘Yes, you can’\*\*
You can change your brain in order to change your abilities. That is precisely what lies at the basis of the sort of productivity that Newton, Van Gogh and Ford exhibited. What they did was to grow their brains to fit their area of productivity.
\*\*You can do exactly the same. This book will show you how\*\*

I agree with Marks' comments and strongly recommend the book. I already have a few of Mark's previous works - so when this came out last summer I did not look at ti too closely as I kept up with the blog and assumed I would not find much different.  
  
I could not have been more wrong.  
  
Following recent posts and discussions I picked up a copy and found it packed with fresh ideas insights and tools which are powerful, easy to understand and easy to implement.  
  
They have already fundamentlly changed how I approach my work for the better.  
  
Buy the book!  
  
You will not regret it...

hi,  
does the book talk about your no-list system?

I would second Mike's comments.  
  
This is much more than a canned, ready to implement process. Mark takes you through the framework he uses to think about productivity. In so doing, he helps you with the fundamental mindset and approach you need to develop your own processes and routines.  
  
Which is not to say that there aren't plenty of tools and ideas that you can pick up and use now.
