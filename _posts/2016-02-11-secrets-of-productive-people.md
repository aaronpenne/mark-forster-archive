I agree with Marks' comments and strongly recommend the book. I already have a few of Mark's previous works - so when this came out last summer I did not look at ti too closely as I kept up with the blog and assumed I would not find much different.I could not have been more wrong.Following recent posts and discussions I picked up a copy and found it packed with fresh ideas insights and tools which are powerful, easy to understand and easy to implement.They have already fundamentlly changed how I approach my work for the better.Buy the book!You will not regret it...

I would second Mike's comments.This is much more than a canned, ready to implement process. Mark takes you through the framework he uses to think about productivity. In so doing, he helps you with the fundamental mindset and approach you need to develop your own processes and routines.Which is not to say that there aren't plenty of tools and ideas that you can pick up and use now.
