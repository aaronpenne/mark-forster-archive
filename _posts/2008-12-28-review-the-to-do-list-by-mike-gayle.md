I have just finished reading Mike Gayle’s new book The To-Do List, in which the author gives himself the task of completing in one year a to-do list of 1,277 things which he’s been meaning to get around to, but hasn’t. I expect most of us could draw up a similar list of unactioned items.

I’m not going to spoil the story by saying whether he succeeds - suffice it say that one of the people he consulted before he started was me!

The book is very entertaining and very instructive too. See how a to-do list can take on a life of its own. Even when he got discouraged and give it up he found that he was still mentally ticking off items. By the end he has discovered a lot about himself and about what is important in life.

In short: well worth reading.

Looks like fun, Mark. I like "gimmick" books like this.

Yes, so do I. Perhaps I should write one myself! :-)

Seriously though, we could all write up our experiences of various time management systems and they could form the backbone of a book. What do you think?

If You think about it life is a natural list you tick off like take first steps or finish gcses with passes we all have goals but this book motivates people to make it a task in itself..I think all of us should try a list and see where the list takes you.. Orla

One thing I need to write a blog post about is what advice I would give Mike Gayle now that my new Autofocus system has been published.
