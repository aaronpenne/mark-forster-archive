Just received the Brazilean Portuguese translation of my book “Get Everything Done”. At last a translation of one of my books into a language I can make a shot at reading!It’s beautifully produced. The only trouble is they’ve spelled my name wrong!

No, that would have been too original!Just the usual boring way: Mark FosterThough on further inspection I see they got it right on the copyright notice for the Portuguese version, though strangely not on the copyright notice for the original English version.

Esta editora lançou um bom livro há alguns anos de um alemão na área de administração do tempo. Mark, escreve-se errado em protugues o seu sobrenome porque não há muita diferença no som com o r ou sem ele. Já me corrigiu por isto há alguns anos.They have already published a good book of a German author about time management.Mark, the reason your naem is written in a wrong way is that Portuguese is a phonetic language and we may not notice the difference in sound with the missing "r". I myself misspelled it a few years ago and you did correct me.

How do your books fit into the AF1/2 world? Of course you must still want to sell books, but why would you recommend them if you currently are not promoting techniques in them? Just wondering! :D

Kathy:I wasn't aware I was recommending them. The Portuguese rights were sold years ago - the publishers have taken a long time to produce the book.And there's still a lot of good stuff which fits in well with AF.

Silvia:<< I myself misspelled it a few years ago and you did correct me. >>There's a difference between someone mispelling a name in a casual email, and a publisher with professional editors and proofreaders getting the author's name wrong on the front cover of a book!It's not just a minor matter either. It affects searches on the internet, copyright, etc.<< I 've just looked at the cover - it is not acceptable for a good publisher ! >>Actually I rather like the cover. It looks better on the real book than it does in the photo on the publisher's website.

I 've just looked at the cover - it is not acceptable for a good publisher !I mean misspelling your name for the very reasons you mentioned and thought about a research in library. A ficha bibliografica contem erro no nome do autor.

I translated "Dot It Tomorrow" in 2007 to Portuguese, in Brazil. They called it "Deixe Para Amanhã". I loved it and more the reason for me to be upset because that other publisher didn't mispell my name. They put the name of another translator there by mistake. And I put my heart in every translation. Anyway, you helped me a lot with your systems. Ah, I'm following you on Twitter! Congratulations and best wishes from Tina Jeronymo. São Paulo, Brazil.

It's Tina Jeronymo again. Please don't get the wrong impression about Brazilian publishers. They are very demanding in terms of the quality of the translation and respect completely the orginal book and the author. Do It Tomorrow was great in Portuguese too. The publisher is very prestigious here. Let's just say there was a biiiig misspelling of my name, but they said they would correct it in a next edition. I've translated more than 165 books and yours was one of my favorites because I could use your useful, genial and practical methods while I was still translating the book. I liked it so much that I used to say people I was translating "Uncle Mark"'s book, with all the due respect, of course. I wish you, your wife and familily all the best. Congratulations for your work. Tina.
