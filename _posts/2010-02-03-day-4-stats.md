Day 4 has gone even better than Days 1-3, in spite of my broadband connection failing late this afternoon which is why I’m writing this at 12.45 am. I’m beginning to appreciate the power of this system.

Here are the stats as they are now:

Feb 6. 0 (36)

Feb 7. 1 (46)

Feb 8. 8 (50)

Feb 9. 23 (39)

Feb 28. 25 (99)

Mar 1. 6 (27)

Mar 2. 14 (31)

Totals: 77 (328)

I'm curious how it will work out after 30+ days.
