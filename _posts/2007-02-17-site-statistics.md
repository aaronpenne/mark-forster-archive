As I have several times written before, Alexa is a useful tool for anyone who runs a website or is interested in websites - which probably includes most of my readers.

You’ve always been able to find out things on Alexa like the traffic rank of any site on a world-wide basis, sites which link into it, and the other sites most visited by the people who visit the site. Now they’ve added a couple of features (or perhaps they’ve just made them easier to find). One is a breakdown of where the readers of a site come from. Here is the breakdown relating to this site:

No great surprises there, though I would have expected the percentage of United States readers (18.6%) to be a little higher judging from the amount of correspondence I get from the US. Perhaps they just like communicating more than the Brits!

Another new feature is traffic rank by country. Here’s the ranking for this site:

It’s certainly very gratifying to find that this site is the 9,908th most popular in the United Kindom, and it’s great to see that it’s so popular in Spain too.

By the way, I used the very convenient screen clipper built into Evernote to extract the figures from the Alexa site.

Mark, those extracts are unreadable by me.

It might be because they are .png files rather than .jpg. Is anyone else having a problem viewing them? I can change them to .jpg, but there will be a loss of quality in the image.

I couldn't see them in my RSS reader (Google) but they're fine on the site - using IE7.
