There’s a slight delay in publishing the new seminar schedule and this week’s newsletter which it was supposed to be in. This is due to the fact that my back has decided to give out and any movement at the moment is agony!

Hopefully in a few day’s time I will be fully recovered.

Lucy and David  
  
Thanks for your good wishes. I'm much better now, though still not quite 100 per cent.
