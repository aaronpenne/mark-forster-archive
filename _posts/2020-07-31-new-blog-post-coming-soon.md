Iâ€™m well into writing an article on which is the best of my systems. This is the result of much experimentation during the lock-down.

One definite winner emerged.

Anyone like to guess which it is?

Simple Scanning or FVP?  
Though I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if it was your old favourite AF1.

Simple Scanning -- a long-list system, anyway, whatever the flavor.

Simple scanning is my guess. And, I kind of hope it is, because it would be fascinating to me if after all of the exceptional work, the countless hours of diligent testing, the unbelievable generosity of all you've shared with us, that you would end up back at the beginning.   
  
Make a list of anything and everything to get it out of your head. Work on what stands out. Stop when you want. Rewrite it if it's not done.   
  
What could be simpler? And yet, this would be the simplicity on the other side of a journey through the valley of complexity. That's what makes it so elegant.

I think it has to have more structure because of the lockdown.   
  
I feel the need for more structure because of the lockdown schedule.
