The [experiment](http://www.markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/3/13/an-experiment.html) about the question “Does using SuperFocus increase brain power?” continues, and the quality of answer has risen considerably.There are still some aspects of the question which I don’t think anyone has touched on, so there’s plenty of scope for improvement yet!Some points to note:1) Please remember that posts should stand on their own, and should not refer to other people’s posts.2) Unsubstantiated assertions are unlikely to score very high in the judge’s eyes.3) You are welcome to make further posts even if your post is still one of the five. However if you do this your earlier post will be deleted, so make sure that you cover all your points in the new post.
