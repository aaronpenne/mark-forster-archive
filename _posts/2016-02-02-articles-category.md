I’ve just gone back over several years’ worth of blog entries to bring the “Articles” category up to date. There are now 174 articles marked up in this category.
The idea is that by clicking on the “Articles” button in the top menu you can get just the main articles in the blog without having to read all the less important stuff in between them.
It’s encouraged me to read back through the articles and I even amazed myself at the number of hidden treasures I’d forgotten all about.
So get reading - you’re in for a treat!
And if you’re too lazy to press the link in the top menu, here it is right here!
