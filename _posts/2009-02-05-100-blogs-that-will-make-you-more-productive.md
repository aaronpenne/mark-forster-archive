There’s a very useful list just been published on www.matchacollege.com called 100 Blogs to Make You More Productive. It includes this site and some of my own favourites, plus some very useful sites I hadn’t come across before. Well worth a look!

I believe the last sentence in the post should read "well worth a look"...

Hi Mark
The only sites I allow myself to visit when I'm taking a break from working are this site and matt cornell's site....besides the news. Some of the other productivity sites are too distracting whereas your's and matt's keep me in work mode yet refresh my mind.
Thank you!
