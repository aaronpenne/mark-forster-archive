I concluded the Christmas period with a big New Year's Eve dinner on Sunday and a big family lunch on New Year's Day. This morning when I weighed myself I was 1 lb below my target weight for the day. This means that since writing my first "Dieting at Christmas" post on December 22nd I have lost 3 lbs. Is this some sort of a record for Christmas dieting? It certainly is for me!

Mind you, for yesterday's lunch I had to refuse the pre-lunch nibbles, take only small portions of the starter and main course, refuse the puds and do without supper that evening. But in fact I found that I enjoyed the party even more for not stuffing myself, and doing without the evening meal was no real hardship. I did enjoy breakfast this morning though!

So the rules I have in force today are:

The result of being under target today is that I feel very virtuous and, what's more, I really appreciate the reward of being able to drop the "Skip one meal" rule. As I said when I first suggested the idea of this diet, it seems to be a nice blend of carrot and stick.

I occupied myself yesterday evening in place of supper by writing all the daily target weights into my diary, right up to the time when I achieve my overall target. It is rather a good feeling being able to say within a pound or too exactly what weight I will be on any given day this year. Completion date is AUGUST 31st - you can work out for yourself how much weight I am planning to lose by then!

Full details of the diet I am following can be found here.

1. No second helpings

2. No snacking (3 meals a day only)

3. No sweets

4. Small portions only

About the same time I read your post, I read this Dilbert strip that was quite fitting... :-)
