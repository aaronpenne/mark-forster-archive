First day of the new website - first day of the new blog!

Not that the website is in the least bit ready yet. I am in the process of transferring the text over from the old website. I won't go public yet for a while. The great advantage of SquareSpace is that it allows blog and website to co-exist. I must say that I am finding it extremely easy and intuitive.

This has all been an exercise in the stuff I've been talking about in my Reaching Your Goals articles. Identify where you want to be. Identify where you are. Start moving towards where you want to be. Keep monitoring where you've got to. That's just exactly what the process has been like. The second I started moving, things started falling into place. Of course I've come across obstacles and dead ends, but I have just got on with dealing with them as they arise. It's only taken a couple of  days to get this far.
