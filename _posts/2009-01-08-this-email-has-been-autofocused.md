Itâ€™s great to hear from the blog comments and Discussion Forum posts how so many people are already beginning to find the benefits of the Autofocus system.

So I expect you want to tell all your friends, family, clients, bosses, colleagues, etc, about it.

One way you can do this very easily is by adding the following line to your e-mail signature:

This e-mail has been Autofocused

You can copy it straight off this page!

This blog post has been Autofocused

Hi Mark  
  
I'd love to add "This email has been Autofocused" to my standard email signature but can't seem to get it to cut and paste the hotlink. Also when I click on the highlighted Autofocused bit in your email signature (on an email you sent me recently) it seems to link to Autofocus: The Book Selection - not sure if that's the section you meant it to?  
  
I'm still loving Autofocus, am getting loads more done, capturing everything I want as well as slipping in the odd out of sequence item without seeming to damage the system much at all as it's so flexible!  
  
Thanks so much.

Depending on what you are copying it into you may need to enter the link manually.  
  
Thanks for telling me about the wrong link for the signature - that must have crept in somehow when I updated it a couple of days ago. I've now changed it.  
  
Glad you're getting on so well with the system.
