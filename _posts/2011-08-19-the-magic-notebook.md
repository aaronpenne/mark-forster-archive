Mark -   
  
Could you provide an example of why you would do this. I'm assuming this is for people that don't have a Scanner (I have the SnapScan, which plays very nice with Evernote).   
  
Interesting post.

Avrum:  
  
The Webcam is much faster than a scanner for individual short notes during the day. The sheet of paper when folded into 8 as shown is a very easy size to fit into a wallet or purse. Normally you wouldn't use the whole sheet at once as I did in my example.  
  
I do use my scanner with Scandrop to Evernote for larger documents.

Borde:  
  
Actually I use Firefox, but I've tried it with IE and Chrome and it works fine with all of them.  
  
You need to click on the pictures to read them. If your screen is too narrow to read the images with Firefox, press CTRL and then still holding it down press the minus sign as many times as you need to reduce the image to readable size.

That's awesome. Makes me want to get a webcam.  
  
Just curious. What webcam do you use?

Logitech Webcam Pro 9000 HD.  
  
Note that this is capable of much higher resolution than Evernote uses for the Webcam Notes, so if that's all you want the webcam for a cheaper one will do just as well.

Well, they're both paper, yes.
