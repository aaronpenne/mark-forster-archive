Actually, the entire interview (for academicproductivity.com) is covered here:

It can also be listened online as a stream (if you don't want to download a large file).

The one referred to in J's comment is the same as the 51 minute version I refer to. But if you click on the link J gives you get Academic Productivity's write-up of the interview as well.
