Good summary of Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play. Can’t believe it’s 21 years since it was published!

Good article. Am I right in thinking that was your first book? I think I bought my copy in about 2004 or 2005. It had a different cover than the one in the "My Other Books" section to the right of the screen. In fact, the Dreams book and Do It Tomorrow have had cover changes as well.

Yes, that was my first book. Hodder's changed the covers in all the books in the series (not just mine) quite a few years ago now.

Interesting article. Always had a soft spot for this book and its techniques (my current Lent challenge is tailored around it). Particularly interesting that the article author focusses more on narrowing down her commitments rather than the time management techniques. That was the part that I did but not in any great detail. Think I will go back and redo it in more detsil

To Mark Forster,  
  
Is there anything you would change in the book or add/remove after 21 years more experience in this field?

Well, I've written several books since then and put loads of experimental methods on this blog. So there are plenty of other ideas which I've come up with - but they don't invalidate the methods described in the book.  
  
I think the book has stood the test of time. It was, I think, the first to describe "time boxing" (though I didn't call it by that name), which is a staple of many time management systems developed by other people since. It also describes how to use your feelings of resistance as a guide to what you should be doing, which is a very important concept.
