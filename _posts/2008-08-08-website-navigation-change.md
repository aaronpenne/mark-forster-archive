Iâ€™ve moved the Site Navigation bar from above the Header to below it. I hope this will make it easier to see. Also if you hover your mouse over any item it will darken.

New site looks great; cleaner and simpler.  
Just on the navigation change there is a lot of white space above the title 'Getting Everything Done'. Without this on the page then more of the important text could be seen.
