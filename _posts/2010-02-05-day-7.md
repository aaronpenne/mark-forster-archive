I’ve now been working DWM for a complete week and it’s still working extremely well for me. I don’t intend to publish another summary for at least a week unless something happens worth reporting.

Mark,  
  
I am reaching the first month milestone with DWM, and everything has been going on extremely well with it. Everything that's left on the list for April 4th is rather unimportant, and I have already decided that I do not care if they don't get done. Everythingurgent and important that I initially entered in the system has been taken care of.  
  
I wanted to ask you, have you anything to report with your first month deadline with DWM ? (It happened more than one month ago)
