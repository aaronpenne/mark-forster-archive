Recently a lot of the discussion on the Forum has been about FINISHING. By that I mean putting the emphasis on working on a project or task until it is completed. One method which I have developed for getting to completion is the 3-Task Method. This consists of picking three tasks and working on them in rotation until two of the tasks are completed. Then another two tasks are picked and once again one works on the three tasks until two are completed.

I intend to run a real-time demonstration tomorrow of how this works in practice. I will open a blog post with a list of tasks I am working on. Every time I start a new task I will add it to the list throughout the day.

My biggest question is how you determine when you are done, and do you rework a task description as you pick it up to clarify? How would you handle "learn French"? What about "buy a new car" when you haven't yet any idea what car you want?

Alan, I think Mark's answer to your question would be the same as that in another thread:   
  
<<I think it's important with large projects to be clear what you mean by "finishing". For instance, if you are reading a book have you only finished when you've read the entire book, or are you taking it chapter by chapter? Only you can define this, and it's important that you are clear about it when you start the task. >> <http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1285362>  
  
God bless.
