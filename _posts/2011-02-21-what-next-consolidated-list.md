Here’s my consolidated list of things I’m going to do now (with thanks to all those who made suggestions). It’s not in any order of priority.

In true SuperFocus style I’m going to throw the lot into my list as one major task (“What Next? list”) just to see what happens!

1. Next issue of the newletter

2. A video (or perhaps even a series of videos) on how to implement SuperFocus

3. Some short (half-day) seminars

4. Daily tips

5. Guest postings on how people are using SuperFocus

6. Teleclasses

7. Re-design website so it is SuperFocus focused

8. Write an e-book on SuperFocus

9. How to handle various types of tasks

10. SF Troubleshooting Guide

11. SF Guide for Young People and Families

12. Guide for Migrating to SF from GTD

13. Electronic Apps

14. Demonstration with Animation

15. Link to SuperFocus rules on main page

16. Daily log of a major Column 2 project

Can I add another one Mark? I'm still struggling a little with the relationship between SF and projects. I seem to remember (but I have a faulty memory!) that this was s subject you were going to write a blog about - you may have covered it off in a post and I missed it. However I know there has been a lot of discussion about this so it might be nice to consolidate all comment, or just right up your thoughts on this. Many thanks for all your work on this.

I suggest you follow my reports on how this project goes. It's a big project with lots of subprojects - it should cover most of the techniques.

Mark, what an impressive list! You must be highly committed to SF ;-)  
I'm looking forward to the results...

It's easy to write the list - the time to be impressed is when I've done it all!

Mark when you throw something huge like this in, will you keep a separate sublist for specifics on each of these tasks?   
  
I'd imagine if you're flipping between doing these 16 projects, you may lose little ideas/notes/subtasks/etc without jotting such things down somewhere.

Only where I need to.  
  
A project should be managed as much as it needs to be, no more and no less.

"7. Re-design website so it is SuperFocus focused"  
  
Mark, it is your website of course, so do what you like. But I would be remiss if I didn't say that I detest these one size fits all formulas. You still have plenty of DIT and AF users out there. My point is that I'd hate to see this become a forum solely focused on SF to the exclusion of your other great products and solutions. SF is good, just not the best tool for my personal needs at the moment.

I'm not intending to remove support for the other systems. But at the moment a newcomer to the site is faced with a plethora of different systems with no real guidance or organisation to help them.

The links at the top of each page should include one to the AF rules, I think - it's a difficult job to find them at present.
