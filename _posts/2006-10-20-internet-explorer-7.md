I've always been a fan of Internet Explorer 6 which definitely puts me in the minority of people who write about such things on the net (though not in the minority of users, as a glance at any web usage stats will confirm). Although I've tried many other web browsers I always find that I come back to IE6.

So it was with a sense of anticipation that I downloaded the new IE7 (a long process). After getting it working (an even longer process), I found it to be a huge, slow, cumbersome piece of bloatware with all the annoying features of the other browsers which used to send me back to IE6.

So back to IE6 I went again with a great sigh of relief, while blessing my foresight in backing up my whole hard disk to an external one just before the download.

Final scores:

IE6                     10 pointsExternal  HD        10 pointsIE7                      0 points

I deeply dislike IE. I've been using Mozilla since 1998 (first Netscape4.X and then Firefox). FF has the excellent extension Scrapbook not to mention many other good things. I've tried Opera, which would be my second option.

Yes, I've tried all those, and always come back to IE. I have Firefox installed but never use it. I know I'm peculiar in this respect!

Hi Mark   
Sorry to hear you had a bad experience with IE7. I have been a longtime Firefox user but I downloaded ie7 about a month ago and have found it excellent. It installed without any problems and is fast and stable on my machine. As with all software the key seems to be does it work for you on your machine - if yes then great if not.. ditch it!  
  
Love the blog keep it up.

Thanks, Gavin. It's good to hear that it works for someone. I'd hate for Bill Gates to lose all that money!  
  
I believe there's a new Firefox edition out, which is likely to go head-on with IE7. I might check that out.
