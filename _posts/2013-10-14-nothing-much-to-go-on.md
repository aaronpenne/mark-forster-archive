For anyone interested I’ve just started a new blog called Nothing Much To Go On. It’s a much more personal blog than this one and will cover just about everything I’m interested in without any reference to what you the reader might be interested in (Be warned!)

However one of the things I am interested in is time management and personal organization, so you may pick up a few gems now and then.

Best of luck with your new venture Mark, I'll be checking it out. Maybe with your latest developments this site may be winded down? Whatever, I do wish you well.

I've no plans to wind this site down. The new blog is intended to be more personal.

What's the meaning of the title?

It might be taken to refer to the difficulty of knowing what the blog is about.
