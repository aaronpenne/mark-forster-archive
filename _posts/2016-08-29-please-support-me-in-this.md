On September 17th I’m taking part in a Tough Mudder Half - a five  mile obstacle course run - in aid of Help for Heroes with three fantastic (and much younger)  team mates, Fiona Campbell, Abigail Sanderson, and Kate Tonizzo.

At 72 years of age I think I’m going to be one of the oldest participants!

Please would you consider sponsoring me? Anything you can give, however  little (or large), would be greatly appreciated. It’s for a very good  cause.

Last year my team raised over £3,000 for the UCLH Cancer Centre - can we beat that this year?

Click here to donate.

And thank you in advance for your generosity.

Over 70 years old, but when he has a photo on his blog, it' some mud slinging rumble fest. Can't say this speaks of bad time management.  
  
I wish you good luck and much success!
