Nothing to report on my diet.

That's quite unusual, isn't it? Aren't diet reports supposed to be full of moans about hunger, confessions about bingeing, and alternating despair and elation about the latest weigh-in?

No, sorry. None of that. I seem to have got used to the amount of food necessary to keep more or less to the target weight. Occasionally I have to use a rule or two, but basically it's just steady progress downwards and I eat what I feel like.

Very boring -Â  I need some drama to keep the readers coming!

Full details of the diet I am following can be found here.
