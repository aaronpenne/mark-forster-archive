Hi Mark!
I promise that this will be my LAST post for today....but if this is anything like a radio station that accepts requests......
The most helpful knowledge and encouragement that you offered was your series of articles about handling backlogs....
That was the SINGLE most life-changing endeavour for me in 2007!......seriously!!!!
I can't possibly express my gratitude to you with creating and sharing your entire system....but the backlog articles (and your kind encouragement) was the lynchpin to my success in resolving this sticking point in my life! God bless your generous spirit and your innovative spirit!

p.s. ( I lied......\*blush\*)
Of course, staying current is the key to continued success via DIT principles, but the fire in my belly was provided to me in the knowledge and implementation that my backlog was a ghost that I could finally exorcise once and for all!!!!
