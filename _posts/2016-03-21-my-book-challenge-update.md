Just finished Powell’s The Military Philosophers. What next?

I think I shall start on one of my major book projects - to read Proust’s À la Recherche du temps perdu in French (I read it in English translation more than 40 years ago). So here goes on the first volume,  Du Côté de chez Swann. Even just one volume of Proust is not exactly one of the shorter books I promised myself in my last update, so it will probably take me quite a while. Anyway, here goes:

« Longtemps, je me suis couché de bonne heure… »

The Evolution of Everything by Matt Ridley.

The Valley of Bones by Anthony Powell
