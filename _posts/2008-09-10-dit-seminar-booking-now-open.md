Booking is now open for the Introductory “Do It Tomorrow” seminar on October 23rd and the Advanced (full day) seminar on November 7th.

Please note that the Advanced seminar is intended for those who have had some experience putting the principles of “Do It Tomorrow” into practice. So you should not book on it unless you have read the book or attended the Introductory seminar.
