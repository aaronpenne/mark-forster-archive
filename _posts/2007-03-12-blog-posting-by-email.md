Squarespace has just introduced a new facility by which I can make blog postings by e-mail. This is my first attempt - if you can read it, then it’s worked.

I’m wondering though if blogging by e-mail has a different dynamic. I know that when I write e-mails to people I tend to write in a different style to how I write when I’m writing an article. Will blogging by e-mail result in much difference to what I put on the blog? I wonder.

I created a Starcraft II site located here:  
  
<a href=<http://www.thedarkshrine.com>Starcraft> 2</a>  
<http://www.thedarkshrine.com>  
  
I am going to be putting on a lot of things to the site, such as replays, vods, fpvods, maps, live streams, tools, esports info and much more. There's a wiki there and really could use helpers to help me out. I hope you guys can register as my goal is for this website to be one of the best SC2 sites on the net. Please register asap as there will be a tournament. If you have any suggestions please feel free to let me know!  
  
Thx. Great forum btw!
