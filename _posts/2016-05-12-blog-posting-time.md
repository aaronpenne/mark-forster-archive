I want to get back to having the daily blog post appearing at 7 a.m. (UK Time) each morning. That means either writing two blog posts today or publishing the post I’m writing today tomorrow morning. Naturally since I’m too lazy to write two posts in one day I’ve chosen the second option. So this is all you’re getting today. Sorry!

MarkHave you changed your policy on daily blog posts or is the current situation only temporary?

No, I haven't, but it's not actually one of the highest priorities in my life at the moment. It'll be back soon hopefully.
