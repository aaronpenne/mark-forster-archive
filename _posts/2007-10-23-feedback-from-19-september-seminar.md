Here is the feed-back from the 19th September one-day “Do It Tomorrow” seminar:

“I have a much better understanding of the process and procedures having been on the course. I found the team sessions and inter discussions very informative.” Alister Mc Kinnon Clark

“Practical, step-by-step solutions to get back on track and keep all my business and personal commitments.”Scott Allison, Access Business Communications, www.callabc.co.uk

“Excellent exploration of the principles and how to make them work effectively in one’s own context/role/environment.”Nick Garring

“Very helpful to recap on the book and to share ideas and difficulties with other people who have read/written the book. It’s now down to me to implement and I am pleased that the day has given me fresh motivation to continue.”Jackie Brazier

Since writing the above, I have received the following email from Alister Mc Kinnon Clark:

Good Morning Mark

Thank you for the Seminar on Friday which I thoroughly enjoyed, and more importantly found very useful. I am very determined to work on and install the principles.

I already have a tidy desk and am working on one thing at a time and have minimized my interruptions using some of the techniques we learned on Friday.

I found the depth that we explored time management very refreshing and quite different to many of the courses that I have been on, this has enabled me to see where I can more effective and also more productive. I thought the number of people attending the course was a great balance and that their input and sharing of ideas was interesting and helpful.

I look forward to implementing more of the processes in the next few weeks and reaping the rewards by retaining my sanity.

Kind regards

Alister
