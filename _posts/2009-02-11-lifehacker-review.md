Lifehacker is one of my favourite blogs - just added my supporting comments (under KittyKittyKitty). Hopefully it will help spread the word! Wow, that sounds really evangelical! I have to say though that I've never been so passionate about a task management system ever. It's been a month now and I still love it. Thanks for developing it, Mark!

It wasn't much of a review.

Catherine,  
  
thanks for your comment at Lifehacker. Very interesting, how you use AF together with all of your other lists.
