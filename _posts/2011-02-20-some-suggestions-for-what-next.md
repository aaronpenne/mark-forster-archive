Following my request in my last post, I’ve so far received the following suggestions (names of contributors in brackets):

I’m not sure I feel particularly qualified to write the the Guides for Young People and Families or the former GTDers, but there’s obviously the basis for a considerable literature here!

- How to handle various types of tasks (Malisa)

- SF Troubleshooting Guide (neumatist)

- SF Guide for Young People and Families (neumatist)

- Guide for Migrating to SF from GTD (John)

- Electronic Apps (DS)

- Demonstration with Animation (leon)

- Link to SuperFocus rules on main page (sindikat)

- Daily log of a major Column 2 project (OhNiners)

These are all great ideas. I personally like development of videos on how to use SF3, an E-book, and a guide for migrating to SF from GTD. I think these would really help get the word out!

I imagine how one day students of computer science course will do homework called "implement Superfocus in \*\*\* programming language". Just a joke but who knows.  
I think that Superfocus really needs intuitive, simple and useful-from-anywhere apps. You might find good to contact authors of autofocus.cc and other implementations, Mark, see what they think of Superfocus.  
  
On a sidenote: i personally don't like the name "Superfocus" because of that "advertising" effect of the word "super"; and what differs that name from "Autofocus" is that the latter had a meaning and association with photocamera ability. Try to enter "superfocus" into search engine, you will find whatever gibberish. But this is only my personal view.

Oh, i forgot one thing.  
  
What you really must do right now is to put link to Superfocus rules somewhere on the main page, so a newbie could find it easily. It can be on "Autofocus system" page near 4 autofocuses, or on a separate page, but this is a must.

Yes, you're right. The reason I haven't done it so far is because it's still a bit experimental and I haven't wanted to go to town on it before I've got the wording of the rules right. People are still coming up with new ways of misunderstanding them, but I think we're nearly there.  
  
It's not been helped of course by the fact that I've been feeling like death all week. At least last night I got several hours sleep for the first time, and today my sense of taste and smell has come back - definitely recovering!

I have been adapting the SuperFocus system on Toodledo.com and I'm pleased with how it is working for me.

One thing I think would be useful would be following a large task or project that you put in column 2 for a week and recording, say, daily logs of each time you worked on the project, for how long, what you got done.   
  
Then we could see:  
- How much time you allot to it per work-session  
- How you decide to tackle it per session (i.e. what tasks you choose to do each time)  
- How many times you work on it in a day   
- What kind of macro progress it ends up equaling in a week.  
- etc.  
  
Would be best for a multi-step involved projects with many choices of what to do each time you work on it (e.g. writing ebook, redesigning site, as opposed to reading W&P), and a week should be sufficient for learning purposes (obviously could get tedious after that).

"there’s obviously the basis for a considerable literature here!"  
There most definitely is, and Im not sure what kind of size you are aiming for for your ebook, but i had actually been thinking for some time now that you should most definitely write another real, full sized book before "retiring" for good.   
With superfocus, and other posts like "goalless living", it seems like your principles and philosophies of time AND life management have considerably evolved since you wrote your three books, so it seems to me that you owe to the world one last effort at summarizing all of your final theories and tools on life management into a book that would be your ultimate masterpiece! You just cant leave it to hard to find nuggets scattered all over a website... You know what spiderman's uncle said, "with great powers come great responsibilities"... This confused world needs you, Mark! And im only half joking...

My intention at the moment is to make the ebook about the same size as my other books - and that will be coupled with a thorough re-organisation of the website.

Great news. Although these are colossal endeavors and I want this to happen overnight!

I would add too some advice/insights on people trying to develop their own systems. Seems like a fun hobby.
