I'm just in the process of downloading the Beta of Evernote 2.0. It appears to have several important enhancements to Evernote 1.5. These include a note list, a way of searching category names (badly needed), a screen clipper (very useful), but still no reminder facility (see my previous post).

I'll report back once I've had a chance to assess it.
