I’m getting on well with Andrew Roberts’ Napoleon the Great, but maybe I would have done better to have chosen a book for demonstration purposes which wasn’t half the length of War and Peace!

I hadn’t quite realised how many words there would be in a 1½-inch thick paperback on thin paper with very small print.

However it’s very interesting - Napoleon’s life puts any novel in the shade. And I am now on page 97 of 820, which is about 35,000 words read - about the equivalent of C.S. Lewis’s The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. I’m sure I got through that a lot faster when I read it thirty years ago, but I wasn’t looking up every person and place in Wikipedia as I was going along!
