The Christmas season is now well under way chez Forster, and a great party on Wednesday evening has resulted in my being over the target weight for two days running. Accordingly I have now got two rules in force:

No great deprivation there yet then, but it will be interesting to see how far up the rules ladder I will get before the season of good cheer is over. The good cheer will be rather limited though as - due to a dodgy tooth - I have been put on a strong antibiotic. This means that I am on a third rule (not part of the diet): No alcohol!

Full details of the diet I am following can be found here.

1. No second helpings

2. Three meals a day only (no snacking)
