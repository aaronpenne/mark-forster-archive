There’s a complimentary review of How to Make Your Dreams Come True on Jennifer George’s Lifemuncher blog.

Forster combines a comforting, down to earth, practical Englishness with a very American understanding of the value of self-interest and creativity

I’d not seen this blog before, but it’s full of useful tips and tricks for everyday productivity, written with some humour and a great deal of zest for living. Thank you, Jennifer!

Hi Mark,  
  
Any idea if this book will be available to buy on Amazon, The Book Depository (my preferred online book store), or Better World Books anytime soon?  
  
I'm keen to purchase it :)

I'm sorry but the book is now out of print, and there are no plans to reprint it. You might be able to pick up a second-hand copy on abebooks or ebay.
