Interesting!! What's the time frame for these statistics? Is it the last week, or all-time, or ???

Sorry, Seraphim, I put this on the first version of this post, but then had to redo it because none of the links worked and somehow the timescale got missed out. They are for the past month.  
  
I've corrected the post - thanks for pointing it out.

It was interesting even without the date range, but now it's even better. :-)
