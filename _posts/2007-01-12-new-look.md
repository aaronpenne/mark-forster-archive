I have been worried for a while that the website is looking rather cluttered, so I decided to take advantage of a new template from Squarespace. I think the new look is much cleaner and easier to follow, but would appreciate your reactions in the Comments.

The great advantage of using a template is that it only takes about four mouse clicks to change it back again!

What about organising a poll using a free Majiwidget: see <http://www.majikwidget.com/>

Dear Mark  
Thank you for the opportunity for feedback. Personally i think that the background is too fussy and makes the sight cluttered. I liked it as it was.

I can barely read the text now with that background! Please can we return to plain white (or at least have the option to choose between style sheets)?

Lose the floral background. Makes reading difficult.

I don't like the floral background either, but I do find it easier to read - probably because the page isn't so dark. Not sure...

Hello Mark, I much preferred the colours/font/feel of the original theme... the new navigation seems more straight foreward but I was actually never confuesed by the old one. best, michele

Hi Mark  
 The 'work friendly icon no longer works if you just hover over it, You now have to click to make it change.

Hi, Debbie. It's not the Work Friendly icon that works by hovering over it. It's the Boss Key on the text only window.  
  
Click on the Work Friendly icon, then the text only window should open. Look up in the top left hand corner and you will see a highlighted box named "Boss Key". Hover over it and the text will disappear. The "Boss Key" itself changes into a "Read" key. If you hover over that again, the text will reappear.

Like others here, preferred the old template. It was lean and clean. The new one is cluttered, like the pattern of a well worn pub carpet.

the coffee and cream/paisley style is too wishy washy and promotes a feeling of 'commitment avoidence'  
  
If you drive a porshe, be bold. Roger.

There is something here I like (the tone) but I prefer the old one. I just think the colours of the previous template could be different,

Am I the only reader who like the new look? I liked the old one too, but this is easier on the eyes and less business-like. The wallpaper is friendly and welcoming, like a granny's front room, (although neither of my grannies would have had grubby wallpaper!)
