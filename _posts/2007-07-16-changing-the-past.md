I’ve spend quite a bit of time over the years talking about the importance of making decisions, and how to keep to them. And today I want to return to the subject.One of the problems most of us face is that we are so busy dealing with everyday decisions that we never take the time to make the strategic decisions that are really going to make a difference. Well here’s a little exercise in two parts to look at those decisions. Set aside a few minutes to do it.** First Part **Think back to what you were doing five years ago in 2002 and imagine that you had the power to go back and make all the decisions that you didn’t make then. What would you chose to change?What you may realise is that the decisions you were making five years ago (or failing to make) have had a profound effect on the way you live now. They might have been decisions to sort out a relationship, or to change jobs, or to have a medical checkup, or to lose weight, or to give up smoking, or to learn a new skill, or to get fit. With any of these, if you had put them into effect five years ago you would now be reaping the benefits. How might yourlife be different now?** Second Part **Imagine that you’re five years in the future in 2012 and you are looking back doing the same exercise. What are the decisions that you wished you had made in 2007?Well, this time you CAN go back and make those decisions… you can make them right now!

Yes, I'll second that. I was wondering what you'd been up to. Are you going to tell us? You have been missed!

Yes, missed you Mark. Your last post before this one kind of gave a hint, but what's been up?This new post is right on track what I've been wondering myself. I can't go back in memory too well of 5 years ago but I did start a visual goal board 3 years ago and I can reflect from that. Yes, things would be very different if I had kept to some of my goals that I didn't do, but I did do some of the goals I posted on my visual goal board so I feel I am different in some areas than had I not done them, eventhough I did not do them all.I've been doing some wake up calls on myself and getting back on track on areas I've neglected in the past couple of years so it is time for me to make a new visual goal board. I recommend others do one it really helps you see where you want to go and where you have gone when you reflect on past years.I really have missed your thought provoking posts and so glad to be prodded again out of my comfort zone.

Thank goodness you're back! I'd nearly given up checking. Do tell us the secret of the mystery absence!
