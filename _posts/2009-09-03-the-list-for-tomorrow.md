This is the list which I will be working on tomorrow. I’m posting it here as a matter of record so it can easily be compared with how it looks at the end of tomorrow.

This particular post will remain unchanged. The actual working list will be published at 8am UK time (3am EST) tomorrow (Friday):

What in the world are you going to do with a guillotine? :-)

Ah, that's a relief, it's only one of those odd Briticisms. :-)   
  
I thought for a moment it was an attempt to break down your "take over the world" task into its component steps.

I'm curious, is this fairly much your entire AF list, or just a subset of it?  
If that's only a subset, there's quite a lot on there...

ChrisKe:  
  
This is my entire list. With this new version the tendency of the list to get longer and longer seems to have gone.

Goody: when are you coming to Reading?   
  
Business or pleasure? (Though of course any opportnuity to visit this delightful market town can only be a pleasure...)  
  
:o)

Do you have to put "wash up" on your list? I always wash up at the same time each day, and it's as much a habit as cleaning my teeth.   
  
I'd love to see your reading list! Reading is my main hobby (calling?) and I'm trying to combine a reading list with my "to do" list.  
  
I'm trying to seriously plan my serious reading. I'm doing this by re-reading Harold Bloom's "the Western Canon" to try to find find "the best", and plan to "read the best first!" Any thoughts on how to integrate such a (developing) reading list into your system?

I don't have to, but I do. I have a rule that if there's more than three items to wash up when I get to the task, then I do it.  
  
You can of course do it however you like.  
  
<< Any thoughts on how to integrate such a (developing) reading list into your system? >>  
  
The tasks "Reading List" refer to articles etc on line which I keep track of on a Firefox extension.  
  
The task "Reading" refers to books. I have all my current books on a shelf, with the most recently read one on the left. When I come to this task, I look along the shelf from the left and pick the first book that stands out for me. I find that works better than putting the book titles themselves on the list.

Seraphim,  
  
Actually, "guillotine" is what it is called here too. At least I've always called it that. However, there is a much nicer version ( but not as heavy duty) which utilizeses a sliding handle. I like it better. It is also less scary ;-)

Mal,  
  
I've been working a combination of the Western Cannon, the Great Books of the Western world (nearly identical) and books from several other sources I got by web searching. I'd love to know more of your experiences in this area. Reading is also my passion.

Guilhotina is also the word we use in Portuguese (Brazil).

I can't recall if you've spoken about this sometime before. Do you also use a Planner or Calendar ONLY for appointments or things to be done at a specific day or hour? And, of course, use the AF4 for everything else? Thanks.

Nelda:  
My system is more a case of appointments and reminders ONLY go into a diary/schedule (I'm using Office/Outlook 2010).  
  
Of course, I may put a task into my DWM/AF list, 'Reminder: draft report ready by 31 July 2010', then use Outlook Task reminder to bring it up on a date before that.  
  
I'm also setting aside some blocks of time in the schedule to focus on certain tasks or groups of tasks.  
  
A recent addition to my system (DWM) is to create a Daily Closed List of tasks that I feel MUST be done on the day, work tasks list from the top down, personal tasks from the bottom up, both on the same page in a Moleskine pocket notebook. Such target tasks are culled from my main DWM (or AF if you use that) list.  
  
For the main DWM/AF list, I have moved since the very beginning of AF from A4 to A5, to Moleskine Large (about A5), and now to Moleskine pocket book; both the DWM and Daily Closed List notebooks are in my shirt pocket.
