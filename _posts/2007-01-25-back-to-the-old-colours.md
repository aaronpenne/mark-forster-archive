Thanks to everyone who commented on the new colours for the site. Since the majority of people werenâ€™t that keen on them, I have decided, as you can see, to revert to the old colours.

I'm so new here, I joined during your 'New Colours' period. I must say I much prefer the Old Colours, which are new to me, if you follow me!

Now I have finally decided to stick with the old colours, I can spend some time fine-tuning them.
