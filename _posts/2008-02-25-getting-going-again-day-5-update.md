Yesterday was Sunday, so I did no work at all and only switched my computer on in order to watch a downloaded TV programme. So no Will Do list - no Task Diary - though a few ideas did occur to me during the day which I added to the Task Diary for tomorrow. Having somewhere to stash ideas meant that I wasn’t tempted to do some work on them since I knew that I would be able to deal with them on Monday. So today (Monday) I have two days worth of email, paper and voicemail to deal with. That shouldn’t be any problem as long as I get on with it.Although I gave myself a rest from the DIT system on Sunday, I went through the day using the method for preventing resistance which I described a couple of days ago in my posting Structure v. No Structure. It worked extremely well.The one thing I would really like to achieve today is to get to the end of my paper backlog. So I am going to concentrate on getting that finished, even if it means that I don’t get through everything else.Buy Do It Tomorrow
