There’s an interesting article on the Fast Company site about how the brain sorts what is important and what is not. Sleep is a particularly essential part of this process.

Here’s how I suggest that you make this work for you if you are using a no-list method. Read the list of what you have done today to yourself immediately before you go to sleep.

You can use this during the day too if you have suitable facilities at your place of work. Read the list of what you have done so far and then take a 10 minute nap.

Thanks for the article, Mark. My effectiveness and productivity is highest in the morning and then declines over time as fatigue steps in. I sometimes take a nap, but have mixed results on waking up from a nap - sometimes I am effective and sometimes it feels like the cobwebs in my brain take a while to clear. Maybe my naps are too long since I see that the article recommends short 10-20 minute naps. I'll have to try that a few times and see if it makes a difference.
