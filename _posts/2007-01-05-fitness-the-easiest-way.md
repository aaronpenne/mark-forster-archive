Yesterday I wrote about how I would like to develop a fitness programme which would be as easy as possible and involve no great efforts of willpower. One in fact that would fit nicely with my Do It Tomorrow time management system and my (so far) extremely easy and effective diet method (must think of a name for it!). After all if you can come to this website and learn how to control your time effectively and easily, to control your weight effectively and easily and to control your fitness effectively and easily - more effectively and easily than anywhere else in fact - wouldn't that be something?

Anyway, I've been thinking about how I might develop this fitness programme, and for each of the three areas of fitness which I mentioned yesterday (aerobic capacity, strength, flexibility) a word has come into my mind:

So can I combine dancing, isometrics and stretching into one system? Hmm... I think so!

More soon.

- Aerobic capacity: dancing

- Strength: isometrics

- Flexibility: stretching

Given that you are on a modified No S diet, I assume you've checked out the diet's creator's recommendations for exercise?

Thanks, Chris. Yes, your assumption is correct - I have checked them out.
