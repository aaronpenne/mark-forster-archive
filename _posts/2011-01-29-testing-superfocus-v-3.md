As has been mentioned several times in the review of the systems, there is a revision of SuperFocus being tested at the moment by me which promises to solve all the problems which the other systems have.

I have been testing it now for eight days. I set myself several benchmarks, all of which so far have progressed extemely well. You can read about the testing here.

The new rules only effect the way in which the second column in SuperFocus is used. The basic structure of SuperFocus remains unchanged. However, although the change is relatively minor, the effect is enormous. I really believe that the perfect balance between easy tasks and difficult tasks, and urgent tasks and non-urgent tasks can be achieved through this system.

Iâ€™m now going to set myself a few more goals to be carried out through the use of the system. These will include more frequent blogging, getting my newsletter moving again, arranging some seminars and re-orientating my website to the new system.

I see these as part of the testing of the system. So you can see for yourself what the system is capable of achieving.
