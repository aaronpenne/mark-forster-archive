After several days on the "No Seconds" rule, my weight suddenly decided this morning to plunge to 3.5 lbs below my target weight for the day. I've no idea why - but one's weight never behaves as predictably as one would like. Anyway that means the "No Seconds" rule comes off and I am back to eating what I like, when I like and in what quantities I like. With Christmas getting closer and closer I am quite happy about being a few pounds under my target weight.

By the way my definition of "No Seconds" is "no second helpings", a much easier rule to keep than the "No S Diet" definition of only one plate of food during a meal.

So far I have been doing my composite diet for a week and a half during which I have lost 5 lbs. The only change I have made to my normal eating habits is to avoid eating second helpings for a few days. This must be about the easiest diet I have ever been on.

Full details of the diet I am following can be found here.

Hi Mark,  
my first post to you, so I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate 'Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play'.  
  
Secondly, the weight thing. Congratulations on your effort to lose weight, but I have a small worry, and that is your daily weighings (and reacting accroding to them. Your weight can easily fluctuate 3-4 pounds over the course of the day, depending on time, when you at, when you went to the bathroom etc. Relying on that will not give an accurate picture of you weight loss/gain.  
Skim through this page to get an overview: <http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/signalnoise.html>  
  
Basically, consider plotting your daily weighings in excel, on a 5 day moving average, and use the moving average to modify your diet.  
  
:D

Dear Pearl  
  
Thanks for taking the time to post. You are quite correct about the fluctuations in weight in the course of a day. I always weigh myself after going to the bathroom, immediately on getting up.  
  
Of course even when one is careful to weigh at the same time each day, one's weight still fluctuates unpredictably from day to day, and most domestic scales are not particularly accurate either. However Morehouse makes the point that the secret is to treat your daily weighings AS IF they were accurate. This works perfectly well because the adjustments I make each day are quite small. The smoothing effect therefore is in effect built into the response rather than into the weighing.
