We all know that Google is not just a search engine by now, but Google has a whole range of functions of which most people are unaware. Here’s a couple:

Dictionary. Type “define:” (without the quotation marks) plus a word into the seach box and you will get a list of web definitions. Try it with “define: time management” and see what you get. Don’t forget the colon after “define”.

Clock. Type “time” (again without the quotation marks) into the search box and it will come up with the correct time where you are located. Very useful for days on which the time has changed like today! Or you can type “time:” plus a place name and you will get the time anywhere in the world, e.g. time: Moscow.

Didn't know about the time command - neat! Generally I use Firefox's Smart Keywords feature to speed up my research. For example,  
  
'wp <xx>' looks up an entry on Wikipedia  
'am <xx>' "" Amazon books  
'li <xx>' "" LinkedIn  
...  
  
I listed a few more in
