Farewell to Meta-Activity (I hope)  
  
Over the past few years I have spent a lot of time and attention researching, setting up and fiddling with different time management / productivity / "personal workflow" methods. In that time I have been getting more, not less, frustrated that I am not getting the exponential, miraculous productivity improvements that have been suggested.  
  
I think that the reason is that, for many, the time management system has become an end in itself. It is too easy either to spend hours and hours polishing different lists. Or vacillating about starting a piece of work and instead get tied up, distracted and demoralised by the nagging doubt that you should actually be working on something else. Its also far too easy in that moment of distraction to spend the next hour on a time management junkie's forum somewhere checking whether someone else has just found the magic button.  
  
Autofocus seems to be the antidote; Write a list. Pick a task from a subset of that list. Rinse and repeat. Seems to me that the key thing now is to resist any little whispering voice telling you to make it more complicated...

I have not perfect AutoFocus, but, man, it's clear and simple and really seems to help poin the way.
