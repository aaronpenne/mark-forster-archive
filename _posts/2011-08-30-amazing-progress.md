The new Final Version system is beginning to show its real capability as more and more things get sorted. Today I succeeded in shifting the most enormous work load while experiencing absolutely no resistance.Getting the basic stuff under control goes without question. There’s not been the slightest doubt that my email, paper and phone calls would remain cleared all day, that my office would remain tidy, that the household chores would be done right on time, that comments on this website wouldl be read and answered. That’s just the light relief.What is hugely more impressive is the progress that I’ve made on more serious projects. Things are really beginning to move, although it’s early days yet on most of them.In spite of this, the system is running too fast at the moment because the workload isn’t heavy enough. One of the great advantages of the Final Version is that you can precisely balance your workload to the system. It does this in a much more sophisticated way than Do It Tomorrow did. This is a bit of a new experience for me - I haven’t had a time management system before which tells me that I’m not giving it enough work!Tomorrow I’m away for most of the day on a visit to the Houses of Parliament so I’ll be interested to see how the system deals with a very short work time.

+JMJ+Seems very promising Mark!Can the Final Version be used in a small notebook like my 3x5 fliptop? I can use the notebook for AF1 because with opposing pages open the total number of lines is 32, but I could not use it for SF because columns cannot be made in such a narrow space.Godspeed.

I'm getting excited for this new system, Mark. And I'm really hoping that I don't have to wait for 3 months before getting to try it. ;-)

Definitely an impressive emotional state to be in! I can't wait until it's published. I greatly anticipate it.

I'll be very interested to see your system. Even after getting AF1 and SFv3 dismissal to work more effectively, I still tend to overstress all my systems by my overcommitments and interests.

Hello Mark,How long have you been using FV yet ? The description sounds promising.

nuntym:<< Can the Final Version be used in a small notebook like my 3x5 fliptop? >>Probably. There's only one column, but the page lengths aren't fixed.

"I haven’t had a time management system before which tells me that I’m not giving it enough work!"My guess is this system evolves around dreams. It's probably not that there's nothing to do, but rather not the kind of things Mark chose to emphasize."Getting the basic stuff under control goes without question."
This because part of Mark's dream is keeping these under control, and therefore with this priority set, the system enabled him to do such. Now, how?

For my part I've taken to putting my key goals in the active page of my notebook, and its effect is to get me to generate and to select goal-related tasks for action. My first major success was yesterday. not at all the same as a precisely balanced and optimizing workload, but still is great.

Wow it sounds amazing! Really looking forward to hearing more about this. I have a dream that I can get my house/desk/workload under control one day! Would save indulging in de-stressing techniques!

"Less than a week in its present form."
Tell-tale words, IMHO.
I'm eager to hear about the new "system-to-end-all-systems" but until it's been up and running for a month or more I will remain skeptical (respectfully so).

Maybe then we'll have the 'eternally ultimate-last-word-in-time-management-systems' version, tested for a whopping four or five weeks.Sarcasm aside, I have really gotten a bit tired of the ever-changing nature of all those 'systems' presented here, varying not only in refinements, but in fundamental architecture.
While there is a certain constant theme in all this (which I admit), the amount of change is a bit much for me.Maybe it would be a good idea to tone down both announcements and expectations a bit, and take all this more like it is (IMHO): a never-ending brainstorming fest.That being said, yes, I'm also curious how the (maybe-not-so-)'final' version looks like.With all due respect,
Alex

Alex W.<< While there is a certain constant theme in all this (which I admit), the amount of change is a bit much for me. >>Well, in that case why don't you just stick with the first system you came across and stop there? No one is obliged to read this website, still less try out the systems.

Alex W.You're right, Mark is on a personal quest for a system that relieves him, and sharing it. You're not obliged in any manner to follow his evolution.Different things work for different people. I know that most systems - by Mark, or David Allen, or whoever - that I have tried worked for some weeks and then the magic worn off (sometimes because they worked too well and I was left with nothing to do, and the system got useless when I finally could play videogames without feeling guilty) I was not looking for something that suited ME, but just a magic wand.If you wait for Mark to find the perfect fit solution for you, you'll be disappointed.Yet, I like reading about Mark's ideas. I'm learning a lot while he's trying.

"If you wait for Mark to find the perfect fit solution for you, you'll be disappointed."Personally, I don't expect a perfect system, but I have a lot of faith in Mark. I say that because AF1 for me was such a positive revolution in the way I did my work. I think Mark has a particular genius that is rare and quite original. His approach to time management has been genuinely helpful, (although of course not always perfect) and I think many others find this as well.One point further, Mark's originality and creativity tends to inspire creativity and originality in others as well, Hence this rather prolific and interesting forum. I think the word for this is "synergy."

Mark, you must have brought home quite a backlog from your trip to France. Have you given your new system a crack at it?
