I’m still having to make some adjustments to the new system, so it may be a few days yet. I want it to be as good as I can make it before releasing it. It’s getting the precise rules for “dismissal” right which is causing the delay.

Thank you Mark, we all really really appreciate your generosity here. Take the time you think you need to be satisfied with your product. We'll be glad to play with it when it comes!

Having only been using Autofocus since 19 June, I am already convinced of its merits. I had misgivings (eg won't I just pick the low hanging fruit? what about unpleasant, but "must do" projects? contexts? urgent stuff? duplication? etc etc), but these are fading with use. It looks like V2 will address these issues once and for all.I agree with Charles: thank you very much for making this system freely available (and thanks also to the forum regulars for their ideas on how to get the best from Autofocus).

considering the delay, I wonder if the new system really helps to publish blog posts on time

Thanks Mark, I think you're correct in getting the details right before feeling the need to release it.

thanks Mark
Take the time necessary for the system to be available. Thanks again for all.
I just began my new AF book and it works quiet well.

Looking forward to it. Having struggled to get back into AF and becoming REALLY disorganiased after going on holiday I tried to today to strictly apply the rules and realised where I had been going wrong - not following the rules. For that reason I appreciate how important it is for you to get the rules right before releaseMany thanks

I'm really curious how much I will have to change for autofocus.cc to work with the AF2 rules. I know you said we can use the same list with both systems, but my guess is that won't hold for a digital implementation that really models the workflow.

@M_N: I'm not aware of any deadlines Mark missed due to using the new system. It also seems illogical to draw any conclusions concerning the effectiveness of a system that is *not finished yet*.

Mark,Dismissal tweaks ? Excellent. Now I am even more excited about the upcoming launch. With a holiday weekend coming in the US, I might even be able to take time to change over cleanly.As far as I have gotten, you have already tweaked it in the blog comments, but it will be great to see it formalized in its own release.You need to get more than just fame recognition for this wonderful system. Maybe it is time to make the process into an ebook. You can always send out updates to the buyers. or even an updated version of DIT with AF2 combined in.looking forward to the new system. Thanks

It will be interesting to see the next version. My concern is the cultish requirements to follow the rules. What happened to having and using your brain?

Andreas:You may have to change quite a lot, I'm afraid. But my advice would be to keep the old one going as well because I expect some people will continue to prefer AF1.

@M_N, I wonder which "delay" you're referring to. When is "on time" supposed to have been, in your imagination...?@mbo1915, I'm not sure what you think "using your brain" involves. Perhaps you want to become acquainted with the notion of a "procedure". Alternatively, you might find it enlightening to attempt making something like Beef Wellington by "using your brain" as opposed to yielding to the "cultish requirement" of following a recipe...

Mark - I think you need to add one of those web link things that give us all the option to send you a £1 or something like that.If Autofocus was a book I'd buy it even though the system is published on the web. I think I'd do that to show appreciation and express the value of what you have produced.Is there enough material on this blog relating to AF for you to produce a book or an ebook?Thanks for taking the time to get the system just right - looking forward to it.-Christian

I second (third?) the suggestion for a donation link, or an ebook, or a proper book. I've been using AutoFocus for 3 months now, and it's the first system that really works for me and that I continue using instead of switching to something else after a few weeks. So I would buy a book or ebook, or make a donation if asked for, if only to show my support for all the work you're doing for us.Thanks Mark, and looking forward to AF2

I'm looking forward to the release of AF2 when you've got perfected (I'm also excited to discover I'm part of a cult)!Following the comments about releasing an ebook with details of the AF system, I wondered if you knew about Darren Rowse's new blogging book [http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/](http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/) Although this book is a compilation of information that is already available on his website, it has sold a large number of copies because people like to have a book rather than having to go on to the internet when they want to refer to it.

@everyone I'm guessing that M_N is just as anxious to try the new system as the rest of us, but doesn't know how to show it properly. I don't really think anyone that's not a fan of Autofocus (and who couldn't be a fan?) would be here.No harm, I say.Mark: thanks for your time and effort - I'm really looking forward to your new version! Cheers!

An idea for everyone who would like to buy the unpublished - not even known to exist - hard copy of AutoFocus to reward Mark for his generous sharing of details and answers for free.Go out and buy another copy of "Do It Tomorrow ..." and give it to someone who might need it. That way more folk will get to know of Mark and he will get his royalties. Now, you do have a first copy of your own, right everyone ?This model is similar to the musicians who leave the big labels and self publish for free on the web. Adoring, rabid fans download, listen and then go back to encourage by buying on CD. Well, some of us do - R

...the newsletter and blog entries have been a bit confusing to me, oscillating between vague hints for the upcoming version, "back to (pure) AF" and "AF 0.2". Although I am glad that Mark avoids the image of a hyper productive everything done-guru, I got the impression that even AF 2,0 might not be the miracle cure for writing goals that some of us - including me - were anticipating.Once the fabricated exitement about AF2,0 has ended, the fanboys have sobered up and moved on from being "properly" (@Anon_LF) exited, there will be new great impulses and creative ideas from Mark to try out. I find the high expectations revealing: Maybe progress on one's most important tasks depends less on circumstances and systems than we like to think.

@Kate
I like the idea of a real book to buy on MF site.
The web is great for getting information. But on a paper book you can show examples, have a real executive summury, have the pleasure to turn the pages, to go backward, forward. Most of all a real book can go in a library as a reference. Since over 20 years i still have the best book i ever red about negociation from MarkHCormack "all you will never learn at harvard" hope my translation is good for i have it in French. It is so annotated and highlined that sometime i need to read it carefully just to understand.If Mark, you make a real book about AF, i hope it will be created as a practical manual may be a collect of little summury with example because your method is so great that it must be applied step by step.I didn't at the beginning and this was my mistake. Now i stricktly apply the method and things goes well excepts about what you mentioned at the beginning of this thread.This is the reason why this waiting for AF2 so tease me. I am sure i gona learn a lot from it and really hope to solve a big parts of the difficulties i encountered with AF(1). Chears.

M_N,All productivity systems are really just ways to "trick" one resistant part of you into physically doing things that another part of you believes is necessary to do.No system is going to actually do the stuff for you or achieve the goals for you so I would never look to any of them, even AF 2.0, to be the ultimate answer because unless you (not meaning you personally) deal with the deeper issues of the causes of resistance first then sooner or later you'll run into that resistant part of you again...and you'll be tweaking the system looking for another "trick", or claiming that the system doesn't work.I believe it was Seneca who said something along the lines of...there's no point going on holiday to escape your life, because you take yourself with you.

M_N and others:AF2 is not designed to do anything that AF doesn't do. It's just intended to do some things better. Some people may prefer AF - and that's fine by me.

Frank - I don't use AF to overcome resistance,at least, not completely;) I use it so I don't forget things. When I had less on my plate, memory was adequate. Now, either I have more to remember, or I'm worse at remembering.

AF is a great tool for me. Thank you very much for giving everyone the chance to use it. I am very glad that I found it on your site, because it helped me a lot since I began to work with it 7 weeks ago. I was very depressed, not able to do almost anything except when I had no choice. Now I am doing a lot better, it is an incredible change in my life. I'm a lot less stressed and I don't worry as much as before. My self esteem is better as I don't have as much occasions as before to beat up myself.Thank you again

Topper,"More to remember" = resistance to not taking on too much
"Worse at remembering" = resistance to perfect recall;)

Autofocus is really helping me in several ways:+ helps to remember things
+ helps to overcome inner resistance (a.k.a procrastination)
+ helps to structure my thoughts
+ helps get more clarityThank you, Mark!
