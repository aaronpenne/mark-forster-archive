I started my present FVP list during the evening of 30 May, a bit short of a week ago. So I thought it would be a good idea to show how my list has developed - particularly in view of some concerns which have been voiced about whether difficult tasks would ever get done using the algorithm.

I’ve used the same algorithm all the time I’ve been working this list. I have however varied the question. I started with “What is more exciting than x?” and then changed it to a questionless sort in which tasks were dotted according to whether they “stood out” or not. Currently I think this questionless sort is superior to using a question.

Anyway, here are the statistics:

Total number of tasks entered: 441

Total number of tasks completed: 376

Total number of tasks remaining: 65

I am using a notebook with 31 lines to the page. The pages are not relevant to the sort, but the distribution of unactioned tasks may be of interest.

Number of tasks remaining per page (with cumulative total):

Page 1        0         0

Page 2        0         0

Page 3        0         0

Page 4        3         3

Page 5        3         6

Page 6        2         8

Page 7        5       13

Page 8        4       17

Page 9        4       21

Page 10      2       23

Page 11      2       25

Page 12    10       35

Page 13      9       44

Page 14     15      59

Page 15      6       65

A couple of things to note about this:

1) The first 93 tasks on the list have all been actioned in less than a week.

2) No pages except the last one have more than half their tasks unactioned. (The last page only contains 7 tasks at present).

Yesterday’s tasks (4 June)

I kept a record (by using a different coloured ink) of what tasks I entered yesterday and what tasks I completed.

No. of tasks entered during day: 74

No. of those tasks actioned during day: 40

No. of those tasks unactioned at close of day: 34

No. of tasks actioned from previous days: 22

Total tasks actioned during day: 66

Note that the number of tasks currently remaining on the list (65) is slightly less than the number of tasks I succeeded in doing yesterday (66).

Mark, explain a bit more what you mean with the question less sort?

My Stats per week (followed the "want" question):  
  
Week 1:  
-----------  
Entries: 101  
Completed/touched : 62  
Open (end of week): 38  
  
Week 2:  
Entries: 64  
Completed/touched : 42 (15 of these were open entries from the previous week)  
Open (end of week): 60 (23 of these items were open at the end of week 1)  
  
So it looks like my open entries has grown to 60 or by 22 items with about 20+ items untouched for more than a week.

So you've done about the same number of tasks in a week as I do in a day? That doesn't of course mean that I've achieved more than you have, but it does suggest to me that you might want to slice your tasks thinner. That might help you to get some of those untouched early tasks started. "Little and often" is a good way of getting moving on a project - and keeping moving on it.
