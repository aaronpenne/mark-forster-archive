I managed to reach Christmas Day with no rules in place which meant that I was free to gorge myself as much as I pleased, which I took full advantage of. The result of all this was that I was 4 lbs over the day's target weight when I weighed in this morning.There's another family lunch coming up today. The only rule in force at the moment is "No Second Helpings", so it's a fairly good bet that I will still be several pounds over the target tomorrow.This is all fine. The rules will kick in progressively until I am back on target. The only question is just how many rules will come into force before that happens. If this diet can survive Christmas, it can survive anything!Full details of the diet I am following can be found here.
