There’s an interesting snippet in James LeFanu’s “Doctor’s Diary” in the Daily Telegraph today in which he says:

There should be much to learn from our most senior citizens about the sort of healthy diet that might promote longevity

He then gives some examples of this healthy diet.

Florrie Baldwin, current oldest Briton, aged 110: a fried-egg bap for breakfast every day.

Ada Mason, previous oldest Britain, aged 111: bread and dripping with lots of salt.

Charlotte Hughes, oldest-ever Briton, aged 115: cooked breakfast of bacon and eggs (and brandy).
