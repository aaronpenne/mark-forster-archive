Unfortunately I’ve been having some problems with my new High Intensity system which means that for the time being I’ve been forced to put the projected ebook on hold.

In the meantime I’m currently taking a break from long lists by going back temporarily to my favourite No List system - The Next Hour, which as always I’m finding very powerful.

Was it a problem with the particular system you were using or long lists in general?

Hi Mark,  
  
I hope you are well.. Even though it didn't have the results you expected, will you reveal the High Intensity system at some point?

Yes, but I need to do further work on it first. At the moment I need to take a break from it.

Mark, what was the problem with long lists in general that you found?

Getting the right balance between speed and comprehensiveness.
