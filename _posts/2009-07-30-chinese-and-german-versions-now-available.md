Chinese (simplified) and German versions of the Revised Autofocus instructions are now available. May thanks to Andreas Hofmann and Qinyuan Feng for doing these so quickly.

Hello Mark,thanks for the heads-up. Just a small quibble: My last name is Hofmann, not Hoffman. ;-)

At the risk of being (even more) annoying, my last name is Hofmann, not Hofman. ;-)Rest assured that you're in good company, nearly everyone has problems with my name, especially English speaking people. Mann is German for man.

Sorry, Andreas. I know how frustrating it is when one's name is spelled wrong. At least on a blog it can be corrected - on the cover of the Portuguese translation of my book "Get Everything Done" it's not so easy!
