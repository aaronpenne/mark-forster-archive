I’m pleased to say that I’ve just heard from the publishers:> The book is now live on Hyperink at this link: <https://www.hyperink.com/The-Pathway-To-Awesomeness-bA210AA213D>
>
> Coupon code: AWESOME for $1 off the price.
>
> Still waiting for it to go live on Amazon (should be really soon).According to commenters on my previous post it is now up on Amazon as well, but I haven’t got time to check as I’m about to run my wife to Heathrow to catch a plane to Australia for six weeks. She’s going there for the birth of a grandchild, while I’m staying here for the birth of another grandchild!

I saw it here on Amazon, but the only option to buy is with 1-click and I'm not sure how to use the coupon code.

Samir,
You use the coupon code on the Hyperink.com site. On the shopping cart page, enter AWESOME and then press the Enter/Return key on your keyboard.
Hope that helps.

Stratos:
Amazon.com seems to have made a mess of the pricing. The book is now shown as "Pricing information not available".
Amazon UK and Hyperink are both ok though. The discount is only for purchases from Hyperink.
