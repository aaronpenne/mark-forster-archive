I finished my Will Do list today at 5.30 p.m. which means that I have caught up with the last two days when I didn’t finish it completely. As I said in an earlier update, not finishing the list for a couple of days is no cause for concern as long as one catches up within 3 or 4 days.I would have finished earlier if I hadn’t allowed myself to be distracted by all sorts of ideas I had about improving this website. Getting distracted is not a good habit to get into, but there are times when the ideas strike and you just have to ride with it!I don’t intend to publish daily updates any more as I’ve now got the system working well. But I’ll write about anything interesting that arises as and when.Previous posts on this subject:Getting Going Again

Darn, I kind of like the updates! In what order do you tackle your list these days?

I do the Will Do list in strict order (see the first posting on Getting Going Again).But within the individual bits (email, tasks, etc) I do easiest first.
