I've posted a series of old articles under the Time Management Articles tab, and I might add more to them. But basically it is my intention that new articles I write should go in the blog, which means they can be categorised in the blog archive.

I've been messing around with the colour scheme too, using the templates on SquareSpace. Since this site will be mainly text based it's important that it's legibility is high, and the original template I tried wasn't very.
