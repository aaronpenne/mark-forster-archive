The discussion about missing meals in the comments for [Can I Improve on the No S Diet?](/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html) reminded me of this - an extract from the old Roman Breviary for yesterday's feast of [St Nicholas](http://www.breviary.net/propsaints/propsaints12/propsaints1206.htm#Matins) (the original Santa Claus):*The holiness of his life was marked even from the cradle. When he was at the breast he never would suck more than once on Wednesdays and Fridays, and that always after sunset, though he sucked freely on other days. This custom of fasting he never broke during his whole life.*Is this proof that dieting makes you fat?

LOL! This discussion is funny! I think people are sometimes too willing to give "experts" too much authority these days. At least in my experience in living my life (find your own truth), I think overeating in ralation to calories burned does more towards being rotund than skipping a meal now and again! JMHO I think you are already on the right track: i.e. experimenting to disciver what YOUR particular remedy is. That willing to experiment attitude of yours in relation to time/choice management has helped thousands of people. Maybe you might become the next diet guru as well!

Upon rereading my above comment, it may sound like I'm advocating total experiental knowledge. What I meant was that when I seek to learn anything, I take the attitude of "evaluating" what the so-called authorities deem as true and allow my own mind to process it based on either past knowledge or further learning or testing to decide for myself if it passes the "smell test" (passes as valid knowledge worthy to find a place in my mental referencing system. phew! I hope that helps to clarify things so that I don't create even more replies.....(fingers crossed)
