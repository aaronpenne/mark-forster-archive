When I looked this morning, the ranking on amazon.co.uk of my latest book “Do It Tomorrow”  was 512. Not a bad placing but it could be a lot better considering the results it has had on the lives of the people who have read it. There are ten customer reviews, all of which have 5 stars. And, unlike some authors have been rumoured to do, I neither wrote any of them myself nor got my friends to write them!

If you’ve read “Do It Tomorrow” and have benefited from it, then please do write a review on Amazon. I don’t know about you, but whenever I am thinking about buying a book I always read the reviews on Amazon even if I’m not going to buy the book from them. So they do make a lot of difference to the sales of the book.

And of course if you haven’t read the book, then you can order it here!

I suspect any recent spike is due to discussions of the book in the "GTD" mailing lists. Seems like all the chatter is compare-n-contrast "GTD" with "DIT".  
  
Most of it is favorable, too :-)
