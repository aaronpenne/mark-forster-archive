Squarespace launched a massively improved version at the beginning of the week, so I am going to be taking advantage of the new facilities to experiment with some changes to the website. So please don’t be surprised if the appearance and layout changes backwards and forwards for a bit.

I’ve turned off comments on this entry because it will be difficult to tell which temporary version any comments refer to. However when I’ve got something like a stable version I will post again and ask for comments.
