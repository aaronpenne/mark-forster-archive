I’ve at last worked out how to run a live demo of SuperFocus, and I’m planning to do one all day on Thursday, March 3rd.

[Afternote: This is now cancelled.]

I’m away most of tomorrow, so probably won’t write a progress report tomorrow evening.

I translated SF instructions in French :

I really appreciate your work and i think a lot of people could benefit from your system even if they don't understand English. Therefore i posted a translation.
