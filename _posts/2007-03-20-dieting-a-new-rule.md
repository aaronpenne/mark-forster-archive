I’ve decided that in my list of rules, there is too fast a progression to starting skipping meals. After all the idea is that skipping meals should be an occasional exception, not the norm.

So I have decided to try out a new rule which comes between “No Sweets” and “Skip 1 Meal”. The new rule is:

Single Course only

This means that you are only allowed one course at a meal. And no, you’re not allowed to pile your plate to the ceiling, because the “Small Portions” rule will be in effect at the same time!

I’ve been thinking of introducing this rule for some time, but it was only today that I was in a position to try it out. So far, so good!

Here is another possible rule: no carbohydrates.  
  
Sort of a mini atkins diet where you cut out the potatoes, pasta, rice and the like until the weight is back where you want it.
