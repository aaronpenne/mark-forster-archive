I’ve made some major improvements to [my new time management system](2016-02-07-an-effective-no-list-system-yes.md) over the past few days.  I find that when I’m actively working on something new ideas come all the time. Indeed this is the foundation of the “no list” idea - to keep yourself actively working on the projects you are involved in.This new system now gives 100% flexibility + 100% freshness +100% openness to *[little and often](2016-02-14-working-in-the-present.md) +* 100% effectiveness at providing a framework for developing routines and systems.Impossible? No.What can I tell you about it at this stage?Really only that it’s a [“no-list” system](2016-02-12-what-is-a-no-list-system.md) and that all the principles behind it have been thoroughly tested out and debated on this website in the past. There’s no new magic ingredient - it’s just the way existing ideas have been combined.It ticks all the boxes that I identified for the perfect [“no list” system](2016-02-02-types-of-lists-ix-an-effective-no-list-system.md) and goes beyond that.

Have you decided how we get access to the system. As someone who has donated recently and who received a reply email from you thanking me, it would be easy to donate again and for you to send a pdf in return. Whatever way you decide on is up to you but please decide soon!

Huh, interesting.
Have you been able to combine the "no list" and the dynamic lists into one cohesive whole, or do you still have to have your dynamic lists separate from your system?

Very exciting!
I would echo what nuntym says above. I'm dying to trial the system.

That's certainly a way that I've considered. But I think Paypal has rules about what the Donate button can be used for - and I'm not sure what they are. I've looked on their site to try and find some guidance without success. But I've heard horror stories about them pulling the plug at the worst possible moment. Does anyone know the answer to this?

I don't really understand the question. Dynamic lists can be used integrally with any system - just like a schedule or reminders. There's never been a problem of having them separate.

PayPal are very obscure about it and, yes, they can pull the plug at any moment. They imply that the donations button is only for registered charities and non-profits but I've seen many private individuals using them so it's not clear.
In the end, for my own website donations button, I decided some time ago that it was safer to not have one at all after having had a PayPal button for years. I've looked around for alternatives but all the decent alternatives I've found are not free, so that makes it cheaper to NOT accept donations at all :-)

I have a suspicion too that their rules are different for different countries. Tax and other laws are not the same in the UK as in the US and that obviously might make a difference to Paypal's policies.
I suppose the simplest answer is just to ask them!

@Mark Forster:
What I meant was that I was wondering if you were able to place dynamic lists into your "no list" so that you do not need separate pages or sheets of paper for each.
From your answer I guess you haven't. But that's OK, Mike Brown in the forums gave me an inspiration to use new sheets of paper everyday folded and cut into 16-page pamphlets, enough space for a "no list" and dynamic lists for one day, which I can discard at the end of the day.

A situation came up today that I'd be interested to hear about how you would deal with it in your new system:
Somebody calls me and asks me to do something. It's quite small job and I perceive it as being quite trivial, but it's important to them. I have no time to do it today and it needs doing sometime in the next week.
If I didn't make a note of it somewhere then I'd definitely forget about it because, truth be told, I'm not really that interested in doing it (in fact, I'd forgotten all about the conversation an hour later). But it is important to them and I'd like to be the type of person that gets things done without somebody having to remind me about it.
What is your advice about dealing with things that pop up like this?
Thanks!

The perils of agreeing to do something which you're not really interested in doing!
I'd give myself a deadline for it (end of next week) and put it in my calendar/diary/schedule (whatever you call it). Then you'll be reminded of it every time you do the task "Check calendar".
Only do this if you really intend to do the task though. It would be better not to agree to do it in the first place if you don't.
