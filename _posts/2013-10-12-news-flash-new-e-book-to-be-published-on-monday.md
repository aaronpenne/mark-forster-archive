Hmm. Will we be able to tweak the ebook with our own customizations to fit our life-or-death unique situations that the vanilla ebook can't satisfy? :-)
Sold.

In case people don't know (which I didn't) e-books CAN be read on a PC. No need for a kindle device, just install the software

Christine:
Is that midnight UK time? The publisher is in San Francisco, and the time there currently is 7.52 a.m. on a Monday morning!

Most ebooks can be read on most platforms. As well as desktop, Kindle has apps for iPhone and Android. Most of the time I prefer reading my Kindle-format books on my Samsung to reading them on my Kindle, though it wins when I need the longer battery life (a week plus v. about five hours!) or greater readability outdoors.

Only a few more hours left for Monday, London time. Are there "glitches" affecting the rollout? (Haven't checked US or UK Amazon site yet. . .)

It's an American publisher in San Francisco, so the book will be published in their time not mine. At the precise time of writing the time in SF is 10.12 a.m.

Thanks, Mark. I actually live in the SF Bay Area. Are you going to stay up all night for the announcement? :-)

ubi,
Not a chance!
I've heard nothing from the publisher though I've emailed them to find out what is going on.
Even if it gets published, you'll need a code to get the discount and I haven't had that yet either.

Not sure if this affects anything, but it's a holiday here in the US.

The discount is for purchases from Hyperink. You can use them from the UK.
