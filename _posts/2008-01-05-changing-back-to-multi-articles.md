As I’ve decided to remove most of the advertisements from the site, it is now easier to go back to having multiple blog entries on the page. I much prefer that layout, but it made it difficult for the Google Adwords editor to allocate relevant ads to the page.Should you want to send a friend a link to a specific article, you can either use the “Email” link at the top of each article, or you can click the heading of the article which will have the effect of putting it on its own page with its own permanent link.
