I love the Autofocus System and can't wait to try it out for myself! If you're interested in more brain-smart ways to be productive, just visit my blog on <http://www.aroundtuitorganizing.com.> I've been writing a lot about how and when to best use tantalizing productivity tools like Evernote, Toodledo, Google apps - and more -
I'll be following you on Twitter, and looking forward to many great Tweets! @organizerlauren
All the best,
Lauren Davidson

Lauren: How do you know you 'love the Autofocus system' if you haven't yet tried it for yourself? Seems to me you're just using this blog to advertise other things. Nothing wrong in that, necessarily, but rather disingenuous to pretend otherwise.
By the way, I really do love the Autofocus system & have been using it all the time since Mark introduced it.
