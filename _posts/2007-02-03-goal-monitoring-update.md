I can’t say that my scheme for increasing my advertisement income has worked very well. I ended the month with a daily average of $3.44, which was well below my target. On the other hand for the first two days of this month, the average was $7.12, which just goes to show how much the figures vary - especially as the record for one day’s advertising revenue was obtained on a day when I hadn’t made a blog entry for a week.

I’m going to have to go back to the drawing board on this.

On the other hand my diet continues to work very well. I’m bang on target today, which means I have lost 9 lbs. It’s beginning to be noticeable!
