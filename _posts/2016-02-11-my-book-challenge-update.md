Following a suggestion by Dafydd in the comments to my last update, I am treating Napoleon the Great as three separate volumes, using the three parts the book is divided into.

I finished Part 1 today and am leaving Napoleon for the time being, having just toppled the Directory and become Consul of the Republic.

My next book to read is In Parenthesis by David Jones, one of Faber & Faber’s “Poets of the Great War” series. This is not a well-known book, though T.S. Eliot called it “a work of genius”. It’s comparatively short, so I won’t be dividiing it up further.
