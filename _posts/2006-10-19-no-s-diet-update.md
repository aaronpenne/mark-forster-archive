Two weeks and two days into the "No S Diet", how am I doing?

Firstly, I have had no problem at all in keeping to the diet. I've never felt hungry and I've never felt deprived. I've enjoyed the weekend breaks from the diet without going overboard. So in terms of how easy it is to keep to, so far 10 out of 10.

I know I said at the beginning that I wasn't going to weigh myself for a month (when will I learn not to make promises I can't keep?), but I couldn't resist taking a look this morning (hence this blog entry) and I had lost seven pounds!

As far as I'm concerned that's another 10 out of 10.

This is very definitely not a starvation diet, so I feel quite confident that I can continue. I expect the weight loss will slow down a bit now, but I am happy just so long as it continues downwards.

Glad to see that you're still experiencing success. In my case, the loss is gradual but sustainable, and it's a fine habit that's easy to maintain the rest of one's life. I'm getting to the age where I don't want to make heroic efforts anymore, esp in the diet and exercise realm (buying special foods, hours spent making meals, buying special eqpt, etc).   
  
I use the Hacker's Diet spreadsheet to chart my weight loss. (Google on Hacker's Diet to find its web site.) It uses a running average of the previous 10 weighings (I think) and calculates a curve that smooths out the jagged spikes and valleys of a standard graph. I can see that even when my weight doesn't change for a few days, the overall downward trend is maintained. Very reassuring for when I feel I've hit a plateau.

Thanks for the encouragement and, yes, I agree. When you reach a certain age some things are just too much effort. I am always looking for the easy way to achieve what I want to achieve.  
  
For the weight monitoring I used to use an Excel spreadsheet to achieve much the same effect as you describe. The great thing to remember is that if the moving average starts moving upwards, all you've got to do is increase the number of weeks in the average and hey presto you're losing weight again!

Found the No-S through your recommendation - thank you!   
  
Have done Weight Watchers in the past. It works, but takes a LOT of attention. I reached goal, but couldn't sustain "maintenance" - too much effort. So I'd gain, then pay attention and lose, then gain... The No-S is just less mental overhead. I like it.  
  
(PS - did you look at the rest of his "Everyday Systems" pages?)

I had read about the no s diet, and found it interesting. Probably works well for many people.   
  
what I have found very effective is intermittent fasting. There are many different approaches to it, and a quick google search will give you the idea of what it's all about. I've done a few blog posts about it.  
  
Have you continued doing the no s diet?

and will start No-S on Monday.  
  
Wish me luck!

ubi,  
  
I've used the No S Diet several times and am using it now (for the past couple months). It is always very effective for me. I'm losing weight steadily.
