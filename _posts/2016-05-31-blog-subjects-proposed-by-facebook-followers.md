Here’s the list of replies to my post on Facebook asking for suggestions for blog subjects. I think they are all good suggestions, so I’ll start working my way through them at intervals over the next few weeks.

- I think you should write an autobiography - a blog article would be a great place to start.

- Checklists ?

- Multiple sequenced action projects with fvp?

- Nolist?

- How to identify the less obvious backlogs and work them all. I suspect that simply setting up current initiatives to (1) fix the systems and (2) hack away at or explode the backlogs in sequence might not be the best approach. But this is only conjecture.

- Outliner. Mind mapping. Scatter map.Tools to capture thoughts.Organize thoughts.

- Joe Cool and how he works.

- You could use the Poll feature and seed it with a couple ideas, allowing everyone to vote and/or add their own.

- No list methods for a work environment that contains a lot of urgent tasks.

- I’d also like to see more love for FV (there’s good reason that method got so much attention). Maybe articles about keeping the FV list from expanding to an unmanageable length (I prefer FV to FVP because I tended to procrastinate more with FVP since I would never get to the top of the list (where all the tasks I was resisting resided).

- I’d be interested in a blog post about the psychological forces that make no list so addictive. On the surface it almost seems like just doing whatever grabs my fancy. But somehow writing down what I am going to work on makes it more focused.

- Though I much favour paper myself, I’d be interested in a consideration of very basic to-do apps. I’m thinking particularly of Gina Trapani’s (Lifehacker) todo.txt protocol that applies a simple format to plain text editors.

Mark, I'd love to hear more about your impressions of WOOP and Gabriele Oettingen's book, Rethinking Positive Thinking. Thanks much.

I haven't had much chance to try it out yet. I read it over the last two weeks when I was touring in Romania. Now I'm back I hope to give it a better shot.

Mark,   
Honestly I feel, 'Addictive' is the exact word for describing 'No List', I feel the 'high' while completing a task, and get craving, a empty, missing something, something not right feel if I am not on the lists. Some Brain Chemicals are surely triggered, Dopamine and what not i think.

Starting tomorrow I'll be exploring the effects of the no-list method much more comprehensively.
