If you are a regular visitor to this site, you will have noticed that it has gone back to one blog posting per page and that the advertisements have reappeared. I am currently experimenting with various layouts to see whether advertisements on the site are worthwhile (my initial impression is that they are not). So I’d ask you to put up with the changes for a little bit longer.
