The Discussion Forum is now approaching the limit of 250 Members Accounts which Squarespace allows without my having to pay a whole lot extra.

There are a number of accounts which have been set up but never used. I propose to delete these early next week. The accounts at risk of deletion are:

AndrewW

Balfour

Bobbullets

Djorn

Firstday

Geoff C

Kase

Larry G

leeyho

Marshall

ms

Owen

Peter Kraan

Phelim

Rebecca

smeatho

Stan

Vivavita

If you want to avoid your account being deleted all you have to do is log in. You do not have to make a post. Once your account has been deleted you can re-instate it at any time by emailing me with the details.

After I have taken up the extra places freed by deleting these accounts, I will make room for new accounts by deleting existing accounts in reverse order of when they were last logged-in.

And how do you like SquareSpace as a webhost?

Well, if you want a cheap/free blog for your own leisure purposes then you'd be better off with Blogger or the like. But if you need a large number of web pages, discussion forums, and loads of other facilities I would say it was pretty good, though there are some irritating features.  
  
It's also very customizable and good for pictures. Since mine is a mainly text-based blog I don't use most of those facilities.

I like your dismissal rules here. They seem to have a familiar ring to them.......
