The Discussion Forum is now approaching the limit of 250 Members Accounts which Squarespace allows without my having to pay a whole lot extra.There are a number of accounts which have been set up but never used. I propose to delete these early next week. The accounts at risk of deletion are:AndrewWBalfourBobbulletsDjornFirstdayGeoff CKaseLarry GleeyhoMarshallmsOwenPeter KraanPhelimRebeccasmeathoStanVivavitaIf you want to avoid your account being deleted all you have to do is log in. You do not have to make a post. Once your account has been deleted you can re-instate it at any time by emailing me with the details.After I have taken up the extra places freed by deleting these accounts, I will make room for new accounts by deleting existing accounts in reverse order of when they were last logged-in.

And how do you like SquareSpace as a webhost?

Andy:Well, if you want a cheap/free blog for your own leisure purposes then you'd be better off with Blogger or the like. But if you need a large number of web pages, discussion forums, and loads of other facilities I would say it was pretty good, though there are some irritating features.It's also very customizable and good for pictures. Since mine is a mainly text-based blog I don't use most of those facilities.

Mark:
I like your dismissal rules here. They seem to have a familiar ring to them.......
