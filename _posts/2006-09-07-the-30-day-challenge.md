Is there something in your life in which you’d really like to make a real change, but somehow you can never find the time? One way of doing it is to see how much difference you can make in 30 days. You aim is to keep going for 30 days, no more. You are far more likely to be able to find the energy and enthusiasm needed if you know that your commitment is only for a limited period like thirty days, rather than for the rest of your life!  
  
Here are some of the challenges you might like to set yourself (only one at a time though!)  
  
How many books can you read in 30 days?  
  
How well organised can you make your office in 30 days?  
  
How many prospects can you call in 30 days?   
  
How many friends can you call in 30 days?  
  
How many cigarettes can you NOT smoke in 30 days? (based on your present average daily consumption)   
  
How many push-ups can you work up to in 30 days?   
  
Once the thirty days are up, it’s up to you whether you continue or not. Most likely you will have made a habit of it by then and will continue without really having to think about it. Maybe you’ll breathe a sigh of relief and stop doing it. Whichever way, you are now ready for your next 30-day challenge!
