With just nine days to go before the London Bridgathon, we have so far succeeded in raising £2,000 (approx $3,084), which is way beyond our target of £1,500. And with Gift Aid Tax rebate it will be worth £2,222.50 (approx $3,428).

Thanks to everyone who has supported us so far for your generosity. Unfortunately I can’t write to thank you individually because I’m not notified of your email addresses.

Great success though it is, I’m sure we can still get way beyond it. If you haven’t already supported us (or even if you have), please help us to at least double our original target - another £1,000 ($1,542). It’s for the best of causes, the saving of human life (maybe yours!) not just in the United Kingdom but, through the expertise of UCLH, throughout the world.
