After one week using the FVP method, how have I done?

Total number of tasks entered: 603

Total number of tasks completed: 531

Total number of tasks remaining: 72

The first 149 tasks have all been actioned.

Work done yesterday (Friday):

No. of tasks entered during day: 91

No. of those tasks actioned during day: 52

No. of those tasks unactioned at close of day: 39

No. of tasks actioned from previous days: 37

Total tasks actioned during day: 89

Note that the number of tasks currently remaining on the list (72) is less than the number of tasks I succeeded in doing yesterday  (89).
