Want some imaginative ways to display your message? Whether it's on your website, or in an email.

Have a look at Image Chef. It has some really good templates. I created the image at the left in about 5 seconds. Notice how the text is shadowed in the same way as the sign - and even weathered like it!

Images comeÂ in small, medium or large size (this is the large size).

You create your image in three steps: 1) Select the template; 2) Add your personalised message;3) Send as email or post to your blog using the tools on the site. It's all about as simple as it can be. Have fun!
