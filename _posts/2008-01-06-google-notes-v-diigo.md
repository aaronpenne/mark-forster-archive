I wrote on November 22nd that Diigo was a really useful program, which I was finding worked very well. Since then I’ve been using it a lot and have found it invaluable.

Its main disadvantage is that sometimes it slows right down and becomes difficult to access - it’s only an occasional problem though.

However a couple of people commented that they found Google Notes just as good and faster to use. So I’m going to have a go at Google Notes myself to see how they compare.

One can draw up huge comparison lists between different programs, but the real test for me is which one do I end up using?
