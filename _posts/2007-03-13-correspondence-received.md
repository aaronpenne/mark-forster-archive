Mark,

Its no exaggeration to say that Get Everything Done and Do it Tomorrow have totally changed my life.

I assumed I was a reasonably bright guy who just wasn’t much good at getting things done. With phrases like “he is not a completer finisher” and “he is great at the ideas, just no good at seeing them through” ringing in my ears from various appraisals, I figured it was worth a shot. Your book, as I am sure you don’t need telling, hits the nail on the head. So many time-management systems.. but none actually work.

Your books have made me efficient when I am working, got me started when I am not, and cherishing both my attention and time far more than I ever have done before.

I was just mid-way through a report I’ve been putting off writing for some time. Finally I got it started thanks to a checklist and some 5 minute bursts (just creating a blank document and just saving it with the right filename was the first). Now its nearly complete, my 10 minute timer just beeped, and although I was keen to carry on typing, I’ve stopped mid-sentence to thank you…

I just thought my character was flawed and that was what life was gonna be like, thanks for showing me it isn’t.

best regards,

Andy (a massive fan)
