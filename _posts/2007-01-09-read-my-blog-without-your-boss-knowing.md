You can now read my blog at work without anyone being able to identify what you are reading. You will see the following icon now appears in the left side-bar. If you click on it, it will give you a text-only version of my website.

Please note the Boss Key which will remove all the text if your boss gets too close (you don't have to click on it - just move the cursor over it).

And when you've finished reading my blog, you can go on to surf the rest of the web in the same way!

Oh my word! That's so spooky!  
  
It's interesting that something that could make you MORE productive is still something that could be classed as a waste of time by our boss!

Interestingly enough, the "Work Friendly" button doesn't show up on the page when I'm at work but it does at home!   
  
Looks like my employer is wise to it!
